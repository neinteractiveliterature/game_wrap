This 2-person 15-minute RPG that was born from my deep frustration over
the situation in Europe right now (May 2017). It’s a strategic,
fast-paced, cynical role-playing game where you play either a refugee or
an immigration officer.

You need: around 15–20 D6 (six-sided dice). After you’ve read the
instructions, tear the following paper in two pieces: one has the
refugee’s conditions; one has the officer’s conditions.

### Instructions

The setting is an interview room at the department of immigration in the
western country and the game is structured in a series of bouts.

Before every bout, each player secretly chooses one or more conditions
and gets the corresponding number of D6. Note that once a condition has
been used, it can not be used again. It is therefore important to be
strategic about which condition to use when.

The bout starts with the refugee stating one or several reasons why they
should be allowed to stay, and the officer countering with one or
several reasons why they shouldn’t. The bare bones of the reasons are
given in the character conditions sheet, but players should embroider
them at will and make a scene out of it.

Once the arguments have been made, players reveal how many dice they bet
and then they roll them. Highest number wins the bout, the loser loses a
hit point.

Each player has 3 Hit points. Losing all your hit points means the other
person wins.

The players should finish and roleplay the scene to the just-determined
conclusion (e.g. the winner says “...so you have to accept this” and the
loser says “...alright.”)

Note that if a player has no dice left, they have only a single argument
left: “Please have mercy!” It is worth 0 dice. They lose the bout. Feel
free to play this out.

Have “fun”! Consider switching roles and playing again.

After the game, please have a discussion about the refugee situation in
your country.

Then don’t go out and have a beer, and instead donate the money you
would have spent on that beer to an organization working with refugees.

### Refugee

As a refugee, you are fleeing from death and mayhem (from a fictional
country) and have entered a western country “illegally” in a last-ditch
effort to save your life. Your winning condition is to get asylum.

The refugee player rolls 2D6 six times to get six “advantageous”
conditions from the list below. Roll again if you get the same outcome.
Interpret the descriptions as you see best. Make a mark for the
conditions that apply to you. Cross the condition out once it has been
used up.

* 2\) Your country is red-listed (describe why) 3D6
* 3\) You have a job offer (what?) 3D6
* 4\) University degree (describe what) 2D6
* 5\) Already have a lawyer (how did that happen?) 2D6
* 6\) Professional (what did you do for a living?) 1D6
* 7\) Knowledge of your rights 1D6
* 8\) You are rich (what did this mean where you came from?) 1D6
* 9\) Persecuted minority (which? Why are you persecuted?) 2D6
* 10\) Your country is yellow-listed (describe why) 2D6
* 11\) Media is aware of your story (what is it?) 3D6
* 12\) Married to a citizen (how did that happen?) 3D6

### Officer

As an officer, you are trying to do your job as best you can. Your
winning condition is to deny asylum.

The officer player rolls 2D6 six times to get six conditions to deny the
asylum. Roll again if you get the same outcome. Interpret the
descriptions as you see best. Make a mark for the conditions that apply
to you. Cross the condition out once it has been used up (i.e. used in a
scene).

* 2\) You simply don’t have the right documentation 4D6
* 3\) You first landed in this other western country, you need to go back to ask for asylum there 4d6
* 4\) You didn’t file the proper forms before 3D6
* 5\) Our database has no info on that 2D6
* 6\) You are exaggerating 1D6
* 7\) Look, I’m only doing my job 1D6
* 8\) That’s above my pay grade 1D6
* 9\) Legally, that doesn’t matter 2D6
* 10\) You didn’t file the proper forms before 3D6
* 11\) The person who could help you is on vacation 3D6
* 12\) We don’t recognize the documentation that you do have 4D6
