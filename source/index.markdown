# Welcome

Game Wrap is a yearly publication focusing on the art and craft of live action roleplaying games. We hope to allow for a more fluid exchange of ideas and experience, and wider opportunities for learning from each other. 

Game Wrap will be released online in pdf format as well as in hard copy on demand. We publish articles about larp theory and practice - the process of writing and running games as well as playing in them. We also publish analyses of larp as an art form, educational or therapeutic tool, and recreation. We will include one or two full texts of larps in each issue, accompanied by the authorâ€™s reflective essay. All forms and traditions of larp are welcome. 

We're currently in the process of creating our first issue.  If you're interested in writing an article or publishing a larp in it, please [submit your abstract](/submissions).
