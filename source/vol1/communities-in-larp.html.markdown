LARP is not “just a game.” As a matter of course, communities form
around LARPs, whether around a long-running campaign game, or a group of
people who enjoy playing one-shots together. Sometimes these communities
become close and uplifting, but might, in rare cases, turn toxic and
unpleasant. For LARP staff, ensuring their game community falls into the
former category is critical to ensuring the long-term success of the
group.

To examine the nature and dynamics of LARP-specific communities, I
interviewed via e-mail several people with extensive experience as LARP
organizers, and two social scientists who both LARP and apply their
training to LARP culture.

Meet my interview subjects!

**Jesse Heinig** has contributed to various White Wolf roleplaying
games, including the Mind’s Eye Theater system for World of Darkness
LARPs. In 2004, he started Dying Kingdoms, one of the longest-running
fantasy boffer LARPs in Southern California.

**Aaron Vanek** has extensive experience in the LARP community. He
currently runs Seekers Unlimited (an edu-LARP non-profit), serves as
editor-in-chief for LARP World Magazine, co-founded the Larp Census, and
also works to build up the community of Nordic-style players in North
America.

**Dr. Diana Leonard**, in addition to being a LARPer, works as an
Assistant Professor of Psychology at Lewis & Clark University; her
scholarly work includes research on group dynamics in LARP.

**Dr. Joel Thurston** works as the Assistant Director for the Center for
Evolutionary Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
and in his spare time participates in Dying Kingdoms as Plot Staff.

**Adrianne Grady** is a founding member of LARP Alliance, a pan-LARP
organization intended to support the hobby. She has also done consulting
work on *Role Models* and *Knights of Badassdom*, ensuring those films
portrayed LARP in an accurate and positive light.

I asked each subject a variety of questions about their work in the LARP
community. Here are their (lightly edited) responses.

The first objective was to get a sense from Diana regarding how
communities form in general.

**Q:** *Can you give a brief summary of how social science currently
understands the formation and development of community?*

> **Diana:** During the first stage, *forming*, the primary concern of
> group members is whether to trust the group and its members. In the
> second stage, *storming*, group members test the rules of the group and
> the legitimacy of its leadership. In the third stage, *norming*, the
> group leader’s role tapers off and mutual investment and norms drive the
> group’s activities. Finally, *performing* is achieved, powered by group
> cohesion, empathy, and trust.
>
> Groups will likely undergo periods of re-norming, during which group
> norms must be reinforced and renegotiated in order for the group to
> remain healthy and functional. Groups may even regress into re-storming,
> in which members evaluate whether the benefits of group life are worth
> the risks. In extreme cases, re-storming may lead to member exit, the
> formation of splinter groups, or the dissolution of the group entirely.

I suspect most LARPers can think of of times their own games went
through ‘re-norming,’ or when a dispute caused an unpleasant split in
the community. However, even these events, painful though they might be
in the moment, don’t necessarily indicate the end of the community. As
Diana goes on to explain, “If the group survives this crisis, however,
it can emerge even stronger, with remaining members who have a shared
vision of the group’s purpose and values.”

I was curious how a group focused on roleplay might affect the
development of LARP communities in particular, so I had another question
for Diana.

**Q:** *Communities are often based on identity, but LARP is built
around the idea of adopting an identity not your own. Do you think this
has any affect on the development of LARP communities?*

> **Diana:** Having so many identities at play may just accelerate
> everything. As I said above, as players retire PCs and bring in new
> ones, it can cause the community to shift gears often, which can have
> mixed consequences. I would also argue that taking on other identities
> can cause meaningful attachments to form more quickly, not less. You get
> to know other players on a deeper level because of the intense and often
> fantastical situations you are thrown into in-character. For example,
> being battle buddies and sharing in victory and in loss can be a strong
> bonding experience. Due to bleed (emotional reactions carrying over from
> IC to OOC or vice-versa), these connections can rapidly forge strong OOC
> friendships. Also, since many PCs are distilled versions of themselves,
> IC interactions can be very informative about their personalities.

I had a similar question for Joel, though I worded things a bit
differently to reflect his experience as not only a social scientist but
also as Plot Staff.

**Q:** *As someone who’s studied both social science and led a LARP, you
enjoy a very unique perspective. How do you feel that being a social
scientist informs your take on LARP, both as a player and a member of
Plot Staff?*

> **Joel:** I think that social science research is particularly
> informative for collaborative efforts such as LARP. And I do believe
> that my training as a psychologist makes me a better staff person and
> player. One of the major ways in which I feel its influence is the way
> it causes me to check my initial reactions and examine people’s behavior
> more critically than I otherwise might.
>
> For example, on the whole, people are more likely to attribute someone’s
> behavior to underlying personality traits than they are to the
> situation. So, when I see players engaging in a particular action (e.g.,
> stabbing a defenseless enemy spellcaster), my gut reaction is to peg
> them as a particular sort of player or character.
>
> But, by being aware of potential biases in my thinking (e.g., the curse
> of knowledge), my training forces me to consider that I have a different
> (and, as a storyteller behind the scenes, often better informed)
> perspective than my players, and their actions may be due to situational
> factors—such as failing to receive information crucial to the situation
> at hand (e.g., they didn’t know a ritual just depowered the spellcaster
> and she was trying to surrender).

Whether or not we realize it, we engage in community-building (or
community-destroying) behaviors every time a game forms. Game staff, as
leaders of the community, are crucial in guiding this early process.

My next set of questions were about forming a LARP community. I was
especially interested in Jesse’s answers, as he had experience with
several different LARP traditions at the time he started his own game,
Dying Kingdoms.

**Q:** *When you first started Dying Kingdoms, were you cognizant of the
fact that you’d be developing a community concurrent with the game?*

> **Jesse:** When I started developing Dying Kingdoms, I set out to make
> certain deliberate choices about the community. I realized, as a result
> of experience playing in Vampire games and in some fantasy LARPs with
> bad players, that I needed to set expectations early on about the kinds
> of play that I wanted to promote. This is why I set out to deliberately
> make a cooperative game where players are encouraged to contribute to
> one another, and where all characters eventually reach their stories’
> endings.

**Q:** *What did you find to be the most challenging element of building
community at the outset? Did those challenges change as the community
developed? Do feel like these challenges were unique to your game in
particular?*

> **Jesse:** For me, the hardest challenge in making the community was
> just in recruitment. Southern California didn’t really have a combat
> LARP scene at the time that DK was starting up—it was getting started
> right at the same time as a couple other games—so there were very few
> people who knew what it was all about. That meant lots of people were
> very skittish about participating. Fortunately, I had developed a small
> amount of positive reputation as a reasonably competent storyteller, so
> people were willing to give it a try. As folks had fun, they helped to
> recruit more players.
>
> One of the other difficulties, though not as hard, was convincing people
> of the value of the retirement system. Many players at first were very
> averse, wondering why they had to retire their characters or being upset
> that they were asked to invest so much into a character only to have to
> put it away once it became powerful. Getting people on board with
> \[mandatory character retirement\] was a challenge, but many players had
> at least a little experience in other games where this had been a
> problem, and as a result folks were willing to at least give it a try
> once I explained the idea.

Riffing a little bit on the idea of challenges and communities, I asked
Adrianne about any she has personally witnessed.

**Q:** *What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the LARP
community right now? *

> **Adrianne:** Right now, the community is still facing the need to
> educate the world on the various aspects of LARP and the individuals who
> participate. …it’s slowly getting better as social media becomes more
> saturated with resources and discussions. Many community members are
> still struggling with the challenge of finding their inner strength and
> confidence to project their dreams and intentions to their own liking,
> and reject hurtful (harmful?) elements such as theft of concepts or
> possessions, social discrimination, and sexism.
>
> This is also improving as fewer people are willing to stay in the middle
> and are less afraid of upsetting someone who abuses. There are LARPers
> who study law, for example, who have been making a bigger presence in
> the community - both educating gamers on their rights, as well as
> revealing various tactics that can be implemented per issue. Other
> LARPers who are experienced in first aid have been more willing to lend
> their skills\[…\] Invested LARPers specializing in psychology and
> education are able to inspire and advise by presenting examinations of
> and solutions to real life social dilemmas, as well as more in-depth,
> accurately portrayed, in-game interactions. Continuing to provide
> education and support to the community and to those outside of it is the
> best use of time if one wishes to make a positive difference to and
> improve the image of the overall LARP community.

In addition to Jesse and Adrianne’s perspectives, I also wanted to get a
viewpoint on the Nordic LARP community in the United States. While most
United States LARPs are campaign-style and focus on narrative
continuity, Nordic LARP de-emphasizes that aspect of play and instead
tends towards intense “one-shot” games. And so I turned to Aaron for his
take on the Nordic community.

**Q:** *Do you notice any particular difference between the community
which forms around Nordic LARP and the communities which form around
boffer games?*

> **Aaron:** In general, Nordic larpers are\[…\] extremely inclusive. This
> isn’t really unusual, almost all larp communities welcome new people
> with open arms. However, there seems to be one key difference with the
> Nords: they don’t discourage noobs messing with their systems. In other
> words, if an outsider came in and screamed “You’re doing it all wrong!
> Larps should be like THIS!” they’d probably either point to an essay
> from the 90’s that already did that exact same thing\[…\] or they’d play
> the larp and see why the person is making the claim.
>
> They are constantly reaching out to new groups, new people, to get their
> ideas and take on live action role playing. A group from Norway went to
> Palestine in 2012 (I think), ran some larps, and then worked with them
> so the Palestinians could create their own larp events. Rare indeed is a
> situation where people brand-spanking new to larping are able to design
> and run their own events within three years with the same level of
> respect and admiration as one who has been running larps for twenty
> years. Nor do I see that level of outreach from the American larp
> community—not that it doesn’t exist, just that I don’t see it.
>
> They take their fun very seriously (as we all do), but they also poke a
> lot of fun at their seriousness.

I also was curious about Adrianne’s experience as a leader of a
community that wasn’t attached to any game in particular.

**Q:** *Is there any noticeable difference between the community which
forms around LARP Alliance and the community which forms around an
individual game?*

> **Adrianne:** Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and
> online resources like Google, Pinterest, Ebay, Etsy, and Amazon have all
> made communication, education, promotion, and social connection easier
> and faster than previously experienced. This expansion has made LARP
> more accessible as well, and has helped to clarify what it is and what
> it can be. It is seen as a sport, a hobby, an artform, a lifestyle, an
> educational tool, and a form of entertainment. Its uses includes
> classroom education, military and job training, historical reenactment,
> sports, and entertainment. It’s easier than ever to discover LARP’s
> potential and to see the variety of genres, realities, stories, and
> styles which exist.

Of course, the next question was to ask my subjects what advice they had
for someone intent on starting up their own LARP community.

**Q:** *Is there something you wish more leaders in the LARP community
understood? Do you have any advice to someone trying to build a
community within the LARP world?*

> **Diana:** Mostly I would like to articulate what leaders are already
> doing really well. \[M\]y chapter on group dynamics in LARP (Wyrdcon
> 2013), identified a number of practices that are consonant with what
> social scientists know keeps group dynamics humming along. For example,
> “listen up” and “afters”[^1] both resemble the restorative circles
> identified as hugely important for reaffirming community values and
> allowing informal leaders to emerge. Further, the circular nature of
> these activities may make players feel connected to one another as a
> group of equals. Doing this before and after an event likely helps set
> the stage for emotionally challenging work and ease tension after that
> work has been accomplished. This work is continued in often extensive
> online “shout outs,” which ideally serves to both bask in the feeling of
> community but also highlight what a valuable group member looks like
> (e.g., someone who helps to create fun, memorable moments for other
> players). Being cognizant of the important social work that is done with
> listen up, afters, and shout outs could help leaders to nurture these
> activities more effectively.
>
> **Joel:** If you mean advice to someone interested in starting their own
> LARP, then I’d say reach out to people. I’ve found the LARP community to
> be one of the most welcoming and accepting group of people I’ve ever
> known. There are a ton of folks out there with a lot of varied
> experience, and they can prove a great resource.
>
> If you mean advice to someone interested in starting a community or
> group within an existing LARP… well, my advice is very much the same:
> Reach out to people. Find out ways to connect the type of community
> you’re trying to build with existing structures and people within the
> LARP. Players love new avenues for roleplaying and exploring
> interpersonal (character) drama, and a great way to provide this is to
> tie together multiple people’s stories with an interconnected group.
>
> **Aaron:** \[*asked specifically about Nordic LARP*\] I would recommend
> communicating with the many Nordic larpers around the world and rifling
> through their brains. Second, I would read the Nordic Larp book,[^2] and
> as much of the literature as you can stand, then pick up some of the
> scenarios. The vast majority of them are free, and more and more are
> being translated into English. An increasing number of them are being
> written by Americans like Lizzie Stark,[^3] Shoshana Kessock,[^4] Jason
> Morningstar,[^5] Evan Torner & Kat Jones, and Emily Care Boss,[^6] to
> name just a few… \[T\]he book Larps from the Factory[^7] has more than
> 20 scenarios ready to go, most with a very low barrier to entry and
> requirements for GMs. The Stockholm Scenario Festival[^8] also has a
> great collection of larps that, if not immediately downloadable, are
> available by simply asking the designers, who are always happy to see it
> run again.
>
> Find a scenario or scenarios you like, run them. Some only need three
> players.
>
> Run more, and invite more people, and have them invite more people.
>
> **Adrianne:** The LARP Alliance was created before there was
> unification… within the community… The LARP community now has enough
> resources and volunteers to flourish on its own. If anyone wishes to
> create a community resource at this point or to meet other LARPers and
> try a game, social media sites such as Facebook, Youtube, and Meetup are
> excellent tools with which to make contact with new and experienced
> LARPers. Sharing talents, interests, and education has never been
> easier. Finding a LARP via any of the above online resources will get
> things started—make contact with a player or owner and ask questions.
> One can also volunteer behind the scenes, or offer to play smaller roles
> to learn the system and get a feel for the community. LARPs are happy to
> assist getting a new player into their first game!

And, of course, the final question!

**Q:** *What do you think is the best thing about LARP/being part of a
LARP community?*

> **Diana:** I’ve got to have two—forging relationships with people in
> game that carry over into the rest of my life, and that superlative
> feeling when disparate threads of collaborative roleplaying result in a
> really cool In-Character moment.
>
> **Jesse:** For me, the best part of being in a LARP community is that
> you’re connecting with other people in a shared hobby that you can all
> be passionate about, and you can use that as a way to get to know people
> you might normally not interact with and find a common ground. Hobby
> communities like this are really a way to know people in a proximate
> sense in spite of our internet generation’s tendency to rely on virtual
> connections—like a knitting circle or a classic car group, this is a
> group of people with whom you share an interest, and you all meet in
> person to be happy as a group about it.
>
> **Joel:** Hands down, the best thing about LARP for me is the community
> of people. To quote myself from a previous answer, “I’ve found the LARP
> community to be one of the most welcoming and accepting group of people
> I’ve ever known.” I’ve honestly never met another group of people so
> quick to welcome me as one of their own and make me genuinely feel
> welcome within minutes of meeting them.
>
> The social scientist version of me from Question 1 is cautioning me that
> this may be a case where my personality was actually predisposed to
> enjoy and feel welcome in a group like LARP. But, from the diversity of
> the community I’ve witnessed, I feel confident standing by my assertion
> that the people and community are the best part of LARP.
>
> **Aaron:** This might change any minute now, but currently the best
> thing I love about live action role playing is its power to influence
> and change individuals and society, almost always for the better, even
> if the process is painful.
>
> **Adrianne:** There isn’t one “best thing about LARP,” in my opinion.
> But perhaps I can express my feelings by saying that LARP has incredible
> potential to fulfill any person’s needs and wants. It assists with
> mental, social, and physical development. It can be used as a tool and
> as entertainment. It can challenge or confirm beliefs. It gives people
> the opportunity to connect and grow by putting themselves in an
> environment that they might otherwise have not experienced.

I’m very grateful to Jesse, Aaron, Diana, Adrianne, and Joel for
allowing themselves to be interviewed!

Community is an often underlooked aspect of LARP, but an element just as
important as setting, mechanics and logistics. Cultivating a positive
and uplifting community is key to a game’s long-term survival. Whether
you’ve just started a game, are in the planning process to begin a
campaign or have been on a Story Team for years, keep in mind that while
setting and mechanics can initially attract players, community will
retain them. Hopefully, the individuals here have provided more insight
into how game runners can focus on developing their game’s community and
player culture.

[^1]: The terms ‘listen up’, ‘afters’ and ‘shout outs’ reference social
    customs used by some LARPs to foster their sense of community.
    Listen up is the pre-game talk which reinforces the boundaries of
    the game—including the narrative boundaries (“This game takes place
    in this city”) and the meta boundaries (“No touching players without
    their consent”). Afters refers to the custom of many games for the
    players to meet up after a game has concluded (restaurants being a
    popular choice) and cement their out-of-character social ties,
    usually by talking about their shared experience at the game. Shout
    outs is when one player, either formally or informally, publicly
    acknowledges the good roleplay of another participant.
