### Introduction

Anyone who has played in, run, or even watched a live action
role-playing game (LARP) knows that LARPs in general and interactive
literature LARPs specifically are not like other kinds of games. They
are multi-player games where players each play at their own rate and
where the mechanical aspects of the game are deliberately undergirded by
social interactions. Interactive literature also has a natural help
structure in the form of the game masters, who arbitrate disputes,
provide information, and clarify confusion for the players.

This paper presents a study of help-seeking behavior by role-players at
interactive literature events. The study measures how much help was
sought, the type of help that was sought, and from whom. Also examined
is how a player’s goal orientation affects their help-seeking or
enjoyment of play.

Studying help-seeking behavior in interactive literature not only helps
us understand more about how players get enjoyment out of games, but can
inform our understanding of how people might seek help in other similar
social situations. For example, as K–12 education explores ways to allow
students to work at their own pace, classroom help-seeking can come to
look more and more like help-seeking in interactive literature. Indeed,
as games become increasingly popular in education due to their ability
to allow educators to tap into the motivational benefits of play,
studying help-seeking behavior in a low-risk, game-like environment with
a flexible, adaptable help structure (such as interactive literature)
could help in designing effective, pre-determined scaffolds for learning
in educational games.

### Help-seeking in Interactive Literature

To understand how and why a player might seek help during play, we need
to consider (1) the kind of helper the game masters (GMs) are, (2) what
player characteristics might predispose a player to seek help or not,
and (3) what kinds of help might be sought. In regard to the latter, a
taxonomy of player-initiated interactions was developed (see tables 1 &
2).

In comparison to educational helpers, GMs occupy a space somewhere
between tutor and peer-tutor. Tutors typically have more domain
information than their tutee and also have some amount of authority over
their tutee. Peer-tutors are seen as having roughly the same social
standing as the tutee, and do and are not expected to have significantly
more domain information. GMs are the peers of the players, but also have
more and privileged information about the game and often are responsible
for logistical aspects of the game such as space and safety
coordination.

Not all players need the same amount of help. Different players will
need different levels of help depending on the game-play conditions they
encounter, and this can affect their thinking as they become aware of
that need (Aleven, Stahl and Schworm). Some players will be more prone
to seeking help than others, possibly due to their ability to perceive
their own need for help, or because of some characteristic of that
player which affects their decision to seek help. One characteristic
that might impact this decision is the player’s experience
level—research into help-seeking in learning environments has found that
prior knowledge affects outcomes (Wood and Wood).

A player’s decision to seek help may also be affected by their goal
orientation. Goal orientation can be described as how motivated an
individual is by achieving certain goals. Goals can be divided into two
categories: performance goals and mastery goals (Dweck and Elliott). An
individual motivated by performance goals is trying to achieve a certain
measurement, either for their own intrinsic reason, or to be looked upon
favorably by others. An individual motivated by mastery goals is trying
to improve at the skill regardless of measurements—the activity is its
own reward. Performance goals are further split into
performance-approach goals and performance-avoidance goals.
Performanc-approach goals are focused on the achievement of a reward for
showing success at a measurement. Performance-avoidance goals are
focused on not failing at a measurement (Elliot and Church).

If we know a player’s experience level and their goal orientation, might
we be able to predict how much help they might seek from their GM, and
of what kind?

### GNS Theory

The question of why humans enjoy a particular activity is a thorny one,
part cultural, part psychological, and part practical—how can we make
something more fun? Over the years a string of theories and constructs
have been formed to help tease apart the qualities and aspects of
role-playing that people find engaging. While there has been a recent
increase in activity, historically little scholarly work has been done
on theories of role-playing the context of games, with the marked
exception of Fine’s sociological analysis of role-playing games, *Shared
Fantasy: Role-playing Games as Social Worlds* (Fine). Currently, the
most commonly accepted and referenced role-playing theory for LARPs is
GNS or Gamer-Narrativist-Simulationist.

GNS has its roots in a previous model called the Threefold Way (coined
by Mary Kuhner in 1997 on the internet forum
rec.games.frp.advocacy)—which attempted to classify the motivations of
gamers. It describes three stances that a game master might bring to a
game decision based on the relative value they place on game,
simulation, and drama (Mason). The GNS model restates the trichotomy as
having gamist, narrativist and simulationist values, and where the
player’s interactions support each value independently. The gamist value
rejects the popular stance that one cannot win a role-playing game. The
narrativist sees their character as a part of the broader story. The
simulationist places value in seeing how a situation would play out as
realistically as possible, and as such is the most prone to role-taking
(Coutu; Haas).

While several versions and children of the GNS model exist, including
the GENder model and The Big Model, GNS remains at the heart of most
modern theories of role-playing.

### Research Questions

Prior to designing a study, research questions were framed based on a
simple model of how help-seeking and goal-orientation might interact
with other elements of the game (Figure 1). The model in Figure 1
represents the hypothesis that this study is examining—essentially that
help-seeking behavior is affected by a player’s goal orientation and
their level of play experience; that a player’s help-seeking behavior
and the social connections they have in the game play will affect the
player’s overall satisfaction; and that gamer type (where the player
sits in the gamist-narrativist-simulationist model) can be predicted by
variance in goal orientation.

The research questions the study was designed to address are:

1. Do performance-approach oriented individuals request more information
through help than non-performance-approach oriented individuals?
2. Provided multiple possible helpers, do help-seekers return to the same
helper, or seek help from multiple sources?
3. Are performance-approach oriented individuals that seek more help more
satisfied by their play experience?
4. Is Gamer Type (based on the gamist-narrativist-simulationist theory)
predicted by a player’s goal orientation?

<h3 class="text-uppercase">Method</h3>

A study of three separate interactive literature events run at Intercon
(an all-LARP convention) included 85 unique participants playing 96
characters (some players played in multiple of the games studied). Each
event was four hours in duration, and the participants were evenly
split.

### Pre-event Survey—Goal Orientation and Experience

Approximate experience level was gathered by inquiring as to the number
of events the player had previously participated in and categorizing
them on a 1 to 5 scale. The scale was logarithmic, with a report score
of 1 indicating they had no prior LARP experience and 5 indicating they
had participated in over 150 LARPs. While not needed to measure the
research questions directly, each of the nodes of the conceptual model
were measured in some way, so as to build a more complete data set for
future analysis.

To assess the players’ goal orientation, the pre-event survey presented
them with a modified version of PALS (2000) subscales for mastery,
performance-approach, and performance-avoid. Since PALS is a validated
measure, the survey questions were modified only to make them applicable
in the context of interactive literature.

### Mastery

1. I like roles that I’ll learn from even if I make a lot of mistakes.
2. An important reason why I LARP is because I like to learn new things.
3. I like a LARP best when it really makes me think.
4. An important reason why I LARP is because I want to get better at it.
5. An important reason I LARP is because I enjoy it.
6. I LARP because I’m interested in it.

### Performance-Approach

1. I would feel really good if I were the only one who could solve the
final puzzle.
2. I want to do better than other players.
3. I would feel successful if I did better than most of the other players.
4. I’d like to show my GM that I’m better than the other players in my
game.
5. Doing better than other players in game is important to me.

### Performance-Avoidance

1. It’s very important to me that I don’t look stupid when I LARP.
2. An important reason in how I play my character is so that I don’t
embarrass myself.
3. The reason I play the way I do is so others won’t think I’m dumb.
4. One of my main goals is to avoid looking like I don’t know what I am
doing.
5. One reason I would not participate in an in-game activity is to avoid
looking stupid.
6. Pre-event Surveys were returned at a rate of 90.5% (77 of 85). Missing
surveys were due to players that were late for the game.

### Quantitative Field Observations: Runtime Monitoring of Help-seeking

The goal of this method was to determine the locus of help, given
multiple potential helpers, and the type of help that players requested.
During each game, GMs coded all player-initiated interactions (both
help-seeking and non-help-seeking). Help-seeking events were coded into
four categories: consultative help, validation, information seeking, and
clarifying. GMs also coded four categories of non-help interactions:
taking game actions, game commentary, logistical, and not game related.
A single player-initiated interaction could be coded into multiple
categories.

For inter-rater reliability, the coding system was piloted with three
individuals coding player help-seeking behavior (kappa = 0.56). After
the event the raters discussed the discrepancies between their results,
and the category descriptions were improved, and an additional category
Logistical was added. Eight raters were trained using the improved
category descriptors and completed the coding of a series of test cases
gathered from a panel of expert GMs (kappa = 0.62).

### Post-event Survey

Immediately after the event, participants completed a short survey to
capture their enjoyment and satisfaction levels using a hedonic smiley
scale. Post-event surveys were returned at a rate of 69.7% (67 of 96).
The discrepancy between the number of pre-event surveys handed out and
post-event surveys handed out was due to eleven players that
participated in two games. Only one pre-event survey was collected for
these players, while one post-event survey was collected for each of
their games. The hedonic smiley scale was later coded into a 1–5 for
analysis.

### Results

A review of data sorted by variable, and a review of a histogram of each
variable helped to make sense of the data and check for errors in the
manual data-entry. The means and 95% confidence intervals, as determined
by bootstrapping, are reported below. The mean experience level of 3.61
indicates a prior experience of approximately 60 LARPs.

Although the confidence intervals for satisfaction measures do not touch
the maximum value of 5.00, they are all very close. Looking at the
distribution for the values of responses (Fig. 2) to “I enjoyed the
game,” shows there may be a ceiling effect on this measure. That the
surveys were not anonymous (due to a need to be able analyze across
measures) may lead to a bias due to self-presentation. Self-selection
may be a factor—repeat players have enjoyed this type of game in the
past and sign up for games they believe they will enjoy. Also, several
individuals showing frustration or dissatisfaction were observed not
returning or refusing to complete their post-event surveys, possibly
leading to a self-selection bias towards high satisfaction rates on the
post-event surveys.

###Research Questions

#### Do performance-approach oriented individuals request more information through help?

Research on help-seeking in interactive learning environments has found
that students often use on-demand help systems to achieve their goals
(get correct answers) without mastering the material (Aleven and
Koedinger). If learning the privileged information that the GM knows was
seen as a strategic advantage to performance-approach oriented players,
we would expect they would request more information than low performance
approach individuals. Not only have we failed to reject the null
hypothesis, but the data shows essentially no difference in
information-seeking between performance-approach oriented individuals
and non-performance-approach oriented individuals. Performance-approach
correlates with information-seeking at r(65) = 0.019, p=0.88.

This could be because the players do not see additional information as a
strategic advantage, or because they do not believe a request for the
information will be fruitful—that is they may be self-monitoring their
requests in order not to wear out the good will of the GM. Another
possibility is that the goal the players are hoping to achieve is the
approval of the GM. If that is the case then the player may be
self–monitoring their requests because they see them as a risk-factor
which could lead to a failure in gaining the GM’s approval. One piece of
evidence that this is true would be a correlation between
performance-approach orientation and validation help events (see the
Other Findings section for more on this).

#### Provided multiple possible helpers, do help-seekers return the same helper, or seek help from multiple sources?

Considering only the players that asked for help at least twice in a
single game (N=47), we found that 39.6% used only one helper. Using the
formula below, we found that repeat help-seekers returned to the same
helper 62% better than chance.

There are many possible reasons for this pattern of behavior. If a
player has a successful help-seeking interaction with a helper they
would have a positive meta-cognitive evaluation of the help-seeking
episode. This may lead to the player strategically preferring that
particular helper when they select a help-seeking strategy for a
following help-seeking episode. There may also be pre-existing social
bonds or social bonds that are created through the help-seeking
interaction that encourage the help-seeker to return to the same helper.
Finally, there may be contextual reasons included in this behavior—what
we report as multiple instances of help-seeking may actually be a single
line of requests dealing with the same subject, causing the player to
strategically select the same helper due to the helper’s understanding
of the context of prior requests.

#### Are performance-approach oriented individuals that seek more help more satisfied by their play experience?

Although our results do not allow us to reject the null hypothesis, the
trend in the data is that performance-approach oriented individuals that
seek help are less satisfied with their play experience. We looked at
two populations of performance-approach oriented individuals, splitting
the overall population by absolute measures (&gt;3) and splitting the
overall population based on the mean performance-approach score
(&gt;2.5). For individuals with Performance-Approach scores &gt;3 there
is a negative correlation between help-seeking and enjoyment, r(8) =
-0.50, p=0.15. For individuals with Performance-Approach scores of &gt;
2.5 there is a negative correlation between help-seeking and enjoyment,
r(23) = -0.29, p= 0.16.

Although these results are not statistically reliable, the trend may
indicate that, for this performance-approach oriented population, help
events are generated as a result of less than ideal play. Since
satisfaction scores were very high it may be that, in this case,
help-seeking is more of an optimization strategy than a strategy to
mitigate dissatisfaction. The player may become frustrated if they
thought they had a way to achieve their goals only to fail when their
help-seeking fails; frustration-aggression theory defines frustration as
“a state that sets in if a goal-oriented act is delayed or thwarted
(Dollard, Doob and Miller).” Frustration could be described as having
high arousal and low valence (Russell), which may help explain how
frustration can lead to other negative-valence emotions and reduce
satisfaction scores. That is to say, that once a player starts to
actively feel a negative emotion such as frustration, it will be easier
for them to transition to other negative emotions, which would naturally
reduce satisfaction scores.

If we consider enjoyment a measure of success for the game, we could
state that players who report less enjoyment are more in need of
help—they need help to succeed at enjoying the game. In that light, this
trend could indicate that help-seeking in games and game-like
environments may not hold to classroom findings that those who need help
the most are the least likely to ask for it (Karabenick and Knapp). This
trend has a significant effect size, and it may be worth collecting more
data to see if we can reject the null hypothesis.

Since the question tackles the relationship between player
characteristics and help-seeking events, for players that played in
multiple games, we are considering the average of their help seeking
events across their multiple games. Eleven of 85 players played in two
games, the remainder played in only one.

#### Is gamer type (based on the gamist-narrativist-simulationist theory) predicted by a player’s goal orientation?

That modern role-playing theories such as the
gamist-narrativist-simulationist theory (GNS) are generated amongst
role-playing enthusiasts rather than from research based or academic
sources has lead to many questions about the validity of the theories.
Since GNS Theory considers motivational stances of role-players, one
possible test of the validity of GNS Theory would be to compare it to
validated measures of motivation, such as the trichotomous model of goal
orientation.

A leave-one-out forward ANOVA for gamer type “gamist” generated a model
that included only one variable—Performance Approach. This indicates
that by measuring a player’s performance-approach goal orientation, we
can predict how they will score on a measure of the gamist GNS stance.
Performance-approach correlates with the gamist stance at r(78)=0.411,
p=0.00. The ANOVA model included the three goal orientations as well as
the player’s total experience.

The narrativist and simulationist GNS stances both correlate with
mastery goal orientation. Simulationist correlates slightly more
strongly at r(76)=0.444, p=0.000, and narrativist slightly more weakly
at r(75)=0.408, p=0.000.

These results indicate that GNS theory stances can be predicted by at
least one validated scale (PALS subscales for Goal Orientation).
However, goal orientation cannot distinguish the narrativist and
simulationist stances, which could mean that GNS is not a pure measure
of motivation, but also includes aspects of gameplay. It is also worth
noting that no GNS stance correlates with the performance-avoid
orientation. While this could mean that GNS is incomplete, a more likely
explanation is that GNS is a theory of a system that self-selects
against performance-avoidance. After all, people who are motivated by
avoidance failure are not likely to take part in a game if they feel
like there is a good chance of failure.

It is also important to note that the GNS survey questions are not
validated or guaranteed to accurately measure GNS stances. The GNS
results are best considered as a trend which suggest that more
controlled and validated measurements may be warranted.

### Other Findings

An exploration of the collected data was conducted to determine the
answer to follow-up questions. An attempt has been made to confine the
number of additional tests to a small number in order to reduce the
chance of type II errors. Included with each follow-up question is the
number of tests performed in this exploration.

#### Is there any pattern in the kind of help sought by performance-approach oriented individuals?

This was a follow up on Research Question 1, which asks about
performance-approach oriented individuals and information seeking. The
natural follow-up was to ask about the other types of help-seeking. For
this we did four additional tests, and found small effect sizes for
Consultative and Clarifying help-events. The one type of help that
performance-approach oriented individuals are slightly more likely to
seek is validation, with a correlation of r(65)=0.254, p=0.038.
Performance-approach oriented individuals are also more likely to
initiate non-help interactions r(65)=0.249, p=0.043. That
performance-approach oriented individuals sought more validation also
points to the possibility that one of the goals they wish to achieve is
the approval of the GM, and that other help requests are being
self-monitored in order to help achieve this goal.

#### Does experience matter?

To examine experience in relation to goal orientation, overall
help-seeking and satisfaction measures, nine additional nine tests were
conducted. Experienced players tended to be mastery oriented as
evidenced by a moderate correlation of r(76)=0.307, p=0.006. One likely
reason for this is self-selection—players who participate in many games
are likely to be those who see intrinsic value in interactive literature
and who see the activity of LARPing as its own reward.

Experienced players also tended to perceive the GMs as less helpful
r(51)= -0.359, p=0.008. Since this is a measure of perceived helpfulness
it can be used to look at how a help-seeker evaluates the help-seeking
episode (Aleven, Stahl and Schworm). If a player were to evaluate a
help-seeking episode and conclude that they would have been able to
succeed without help their perception of the helpfulness of the GM may
decline. If these expert players are requesting help in more challenging
areas it is more likely that the help provided does not satisfy their
request. The data collected was only for help-seeking, not what help was
given, so another possible explanation is that the GMs decided not to
provide the help requested—either because there was no additional
information available or because they perceived the player to be able to
resolve their problem on their own.

#### Did seeking any particular kind of help improve a player’s enjoyment?

Help-seeking types were examined for impact on enjoyment, using six
additional tests. Neither information seeking, validation, clarifying,
non-help-seeking events, nor overall help-seeking had an impact on the
player’s enjoyment. Consultative help, however, had a moderate negative
correlation—the more a player requested consultative help, the less they
enjoyed the game—r(60) = -0.390, p=0.002. Simple explanations for this
are that GMs gave poor advice, or that GMs were less likely to provide
this kind of help when requested. However it also may not be the act of
help-seeking that results in less enjoyment, but that they both stem
from another source cause. Consultative help is requested when the
player is unsure of what to do, and it seems likely that players that
become stuck enjoy the game less.

<h3 class="text-uppercase">Implications</h3>

These results tell us not to ignore help events when looking at gameplay
because, in game environments, help events can be seen as indicators
that a player is struggling. While game designs should try to avoid the
need for help events, attempts to prevent or regulate the use of help
could cause frustration and dissatisfaction. Any game that can become
aware of its players’ goal orientation should design in validations for
performance-approach individuals, which this study has shown correlates
with higher satisfaction levels. This validation can be thought of as a
type of route confirmatory sign—confirmation that the help-seeker is on
the right path. One example of this is when players use statistics in
computer and console games to provide active, instant feedback that is
used as a validation measure. A report of the player’s DPS or Kill Count
at the end of the level is not only a summary, but also a motivational
help tool. In Interactive Literature, this might be achieved by making
the progress toward a goal visible to the player, or a GM proactively
telling a player they are doing well. It may seem counterintuitive to
disrupt immersion to communicate to the player, but for
performance-approach players, it might just increase their satisfaction.

<h3 class="text-uppercase">Future Study</h3>

Quantitative field observation of help-seeking in LARP can provide a
unique look into both unstructured help seeking in general and into
aspects of gameplay. This study has started to look at help seeking as
it relates to goal orientation, locus of help, and the GNS theory of
role-play, but many other possibilities for future study exist. Even
just within the conceptual model hypothesis put forth in this paper, it
is possible to ask how aspects of gameplay such as character social
connections interact with help seeking. Might a player whose character
has more connections seek less validation from the GM? Does the rate of
non-help interactions predict the rate of help interaction? With little
prior art in this area, additional, similar exploratory studies are
warranted to help develop a model for help seeking behavior in games.
