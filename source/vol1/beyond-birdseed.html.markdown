    Bringing Immersion to Non-Combat Modules
  </div>
  by Kat Davis
</header>

When one hears about boffer LARPs, one generally first thinks of live
combat. After all, it’s right in the name; boffer refers to the foam
weaponry used by players. There is a common belief that live combat is
all these games have to offer, and that to be interested in a boffer
LARP one must be interested in hitting other people with plumbing
supplies. This belief is untrue.

In my experience, what actually brings boffer to life is the focus on
immersion and simulation through deliberate action on behalf of the
players. One of the main commonalities between boffer games is a focus
on the principle of “What You See is What You Get.” This principle
manifests in the concerted effort by both staff and players to ensure
that things in game can be reasonably represented by visible objects or
actions. One does not frequently see flying, for example, because it is
difficult to replicate flying without elaborate pulleys. Combat is an
important part of the simulation. It contributes to the feeling of
immersion and the conceit that, for the most part, if one wants to do
something, one must physically do it. If one wants to hit someone else
with a sword, one must physically do so. But there are other things that
one might want to do. For example, if one wants to talk a cop into
letting them near a crime scene, one must find the words that will
convince the cop to do so. If one wants to open a lock without the key,
they must actually physically pick that lock.

Most games create a world that drives players to desire to experience
it. As they become immersed in the various stories being told, they get
to confront new and powerful emotions. They get a chance to speak with
non-player-characters and learn about the places within the world; to
break into their “rival’s” base, evade his guards, and steal his most
treasured possession; to entertain at a fantastical masquerade ball. If
the only draw of the game was combat, one would be better off taking a
martial arts class. It’s everything else that makes the world come to
life.

And thus we understand the draw of the non-combat module. *Non-combat*
in this case refers to a module wherein combat is ill-advised or not
intended to be the focus of the module. Whether the goal is to trick a
kidnapped prisoner into telling you what you need to know or swinging on
a rope across a gaping chasm (chasm usually represented by rope lights
on the ground), the player is given a chance to show off unique skills
that either wouldn’t be safe in a combat situation or are focused on
less physical things. They also allow a player to explore new sensations
or emotions as well as unique challenges.

There are several common breakdowns of non-combat modules prevalent
throughout boffer LARPing. The most common, in my experience, is what is
known as the *rogue module*. Rogue modules, as the name might suggest,
focus around incorporating stealth into a tense situation. Usually,
there are some guards that the players must sneak past undetected and
some information that the players hope to get out of the encounter.
Frequently there are a myriad of locked boxes or traps that players must
work their way through and carefully disassemble.

The fun of rogue modules comes from the physical challenge of sneaking
through the module. The players must work through physical challenges
themselves, such as picking locks or dismantling traps, while risking
detection by any guards or destruction of what the characters have come
to find. From an immersion standpoint, the players are expected to
participate in all of the physical challenges themselves. Any lock that
the players wish to bypass must actually be picked by the players with
tools they have brought into the module (most rogues wouldn’t go
anywhere without their “rogue kit”). Any trap must be disabled by the
players before it is triggered. Players must be quick, nimble, and aware
of their surroundings. There is excitement in the threat of failure, but
it is a very different sort of excitement than that found in primarily
combat oriented modules. It also allows for players to engage in things
that could be too hazardous or dangerous in a full combat module, such
as exciting physical stunts.

By incorporating real-world skills such as stealth, lockpicking, or
acrobatics, the participants get to utilize and showcase skills they
might not usually get to while engaging in difficult challenges and
struggling to complete their objectives within the time frame, without
getting caught, or whatever other obstacles the game staff has created
for them. The fact that the players must do all of this themselves adds
to their emotional buy-in and raises the stakes.

A good example of this is a module from *Mirror Mirror* (Chimera
Entertainment, Inc.),[^1] wherein the player-characters were looking to
break open some eggs and avoid the wrath of the blind guardians who
stood vigilant over the characters’ objective. The intention was to
avoid any detection, as the player-characters knew that any detection
could easily result in the very powerful guardians killing them. When
they arrived, they realized that the guardians were servitors of a rival
Fae to the one who had sent them, thus upping the stakes even further as
offending a powerful Fae was added to death as a possible consequence.
The eggs were simulated by balloons with tea lights inside, forcing the
players to use very sharp knives to open them while trying to remain
completely silent. As an additional complication, the module was set at
night in the woods with scattered branches and leaves everywhere. The
guards would wander throughout, and, if they heard a noise, would swing
in its general direction with lethal force. The players were constantly
trying to move around silently and perform a difficult task, always
afraid of detection.

Another common example of a non-combat module is what is colloquially
referred to as a *talky module*. There are a couple of different flavors
of talky module, but for the most part they revolve around the intent to
acquire the objective, whatever it is, through discourse rather than
violence. This breaks down into sub-classifications based on the
objective of the module.

One common talky module subtype is a *diplomacy module*. Diplomacy
modules generally involve player-characters arbitrating between two (or
more) disparate factions. This can take several different forms, whether
it’s players trying to act as a jury in a court where a non-player
character is on trial, trying to reconcile two disparate parts of a
faction, or actually acting as diplomats for world powers of the game
world. These modules highlight players who are persuasive or capable of
thinking of unique solutions to problems. They allow players who are
skilled in oration to shine.

These modules work best when there is already an established link for
the player-characters to either the situation or the
non-player-characters involved. If the staff gives the players a reason
to care about the outcome and establishes the possible outcomes, the
immersion is an emergent property of the puzzle that the situation
creates. The players must solve the social puzzle with the tools given
to them or suffer the consequences. They’re forced to think critically
and speak quickly and charismatically.

A good example of one of these sorts of modules was seen in *Shadows of
Amun* (Older than Dirt Games, May 2015).[^2] Some player-characters were
brought into a group which devoted itself to protecting the Pharaoh
during the reign of Cleopatra. Some of the player-characters’ superiors
brought them in to add insight to a debate regarding whether or not
protecting Cleopatra meant protecting her from herself. The characters
had to be careful not to offend either of the disagreeing superiors
while working to satisfy both of their concerns. On top of this, they
knew that whatever solution they came up with would likely be put into
effect, so they couldn’t just pay lip service to satisfying the
concerns. Each of the disparate factions’ thoughts and opinions had to
be weighed against what the player-characters knew of the situation
(even things they couldn’t tell their superiors) and come up with a
satisfactory solution that would also actually solve the concern of
safety.

Another particularly humorous example comes from *Cottington Woods*
(Mangio and Mangio, September 2015),[^3] a fairytale-inspired game. In a
plotline surrounding the kidnapping of children, Peter Pan approached
the player-characters claiming that the dastardly Hook must be
responsible. The player-characters, having been hoodwinked by Pan
before, were suspicious but agreed to accompany him to confront Hook.
They followed him down to the beach, where Hook and some of his crew
were sitting drinking grog (not real—alcohol and live combat do not
mix!) and enjoying the sun. Pan and Hook immediately started bickering,
as Hook reminded the player-characters that Pan was the one infamous for
kidnapping children. The player-characters had to talk both of them down
so they could learn that neither Pan nor Hook was involved, and convince
the two enemies to work together to find the kidnapped children. They
had to navigate the obvious rivalry and manipulate the
non-player-characters into overcoming it to achieve the
player-characters’ goals.

In both of these examples, players have a vested interest in appeasing
both sides of the conflict to find a middle ground. Each presents
different challenges for the player-characters to work to overcome, and
the players must use quick-thinking and wits to find the words and
conversational directions that allow for success of the character’s
goals. The immersion in these situations comes from the fact that the
players are forced to rely on their own skills of oration and navigate
whatever social issues the game staff has presented. The players must
use the knowledge they have gained in the game and their own cleverness
to solve whatever social puzzle is presented to them.

The other common type of talky module that I will talk about is the
*masquerade module*. This is something of a misnomer, as it covers more
than just masquerades. This module type involves a large block of time
set aside for a ball, faire, or other large gathering of unique
personalities. Usually, there are lots of non-player-characters
representing plot hooks sent out to mingle, armed with information that
the player-characters want. There may be games with in-game treasures as
prizes, or contests such as bardic contests, dueling contests, or other
small tests of skill. These modules are generally meant to entertain the
majority of the player-character base and further their plots through
investigation and socializing while giving them small, fun and unique
opportunities to explore their skills. This is different from many other
modules, which usually entertain a much smaller subset of players.
Because of the shift in focus towards entertaining a larger percentage
of the game at once, the staff of a game can invest in more set
dressing. Lights, props, and costuming allow for a more decorated and
atmospheric environment, which furthers the immersion for the players
involved. They also allow player-characters to push their agendas while
perhaps breaking into different plots that interest them or help their
friends if they are more socially inclined.

*Cottington Woods* (Mangio and Mangio, January 2015)[^4] presented a
particularly memorable example of this when they did a whole one-day
event surrounding the Fairy Mist Ball, an event that touched all
masquerades across time. This meant that player-characters could meet
with any character, so long as they had once attended a ball. Several
players were surprised to see deceased figures from their backstories
meeting them face to face, such as parents or long-dead enemies. They
were able to confront unresolved trauma or wheel and deal for
information. It also allowed players to break out their fanciest
clothing and expand their character’s perceived image and wardrobe for a
formal event.

Several events have done more casual town fair-type modules. In an
*Occam’s Razor* (Darksteel Games, November 2014)[^5] event, they managed
to balance an atmosphere where one could participate in silly games to
win prizes, but also speak to a creepy blind psychic who seemed to have
individual insight memorized for each player-character. The feel of a
small-town New Hampshire atmosphere was highlighted while preserving the
horrific undertones of the game. *Seven Virtues* (Caruso)[^6] managed to
create a captivatingly immersive atmosphere with their Dark Circus event
that brought interesting plot hooks to characters while giving an
experience that one player described as “walking into another world and
losing yourself there.” These types of games exist to deepen player
immersion and the feel of the world around them. The intent is to make
the world feel real and give the players an idea of the way their
character’s lives go when they’re not living them.

Some modules don’t necessarily fit into either a talky module or a rogue
module. *Dreamscapes*, modules where the point is to experience an event
rather than challenge it or defeat it, and similarly strange mods can
also be potent. These modules all generally share the trait of being
designed to evoke a reaction from players. Some dream modules or other
strange settings involve puzzles connected to the esoteric concepts of
the dream, or simply have the players experience a tense or emotional
scene.

*Shadows of Amun* (Older than Dirt Games, October 2013)[^7] gave a
particularly powerful example of setting a scene to cause an emotional
reaction in their players. During a gathering of a mystical group of
player-characters and their Elders to tell stories, a God was summoned
to kill all of their Elders and consume their souls in front of the
helpless player-characters. This is an interesting example because while
combat happened, it was not the focus of the module. The players were
repeatedly paralyzed and forced to watch as the figures they looked to
for guidance were utterly destroyed in front of them. They tried to
fight, but quickly realized that fighting was futile and they were
hopelessly outmatched. The module ended with the player-characters
running blindly through the woods dragging the bodies of their mentors
behind them, shell-shocked and crying from the overwhelming horror they
had experienced. The module did not offer any kind of closure, but it
was incredibly immersive in the creeping realization that fighting back
was pointless and they could not hope to beat it.

*Endgame* (Black Crayon Games)[^8] took a different tack at evoking
strong emotion by asking several characters to sacrifice memories and
parts of themselves in one plotline. This was done through “mind-dives,”
modules where a few player-characters entered another character’s mind.
These modules played out scenes from the character’s past and manifested
parts of them or their personality through physical objects or
non-player characters without any explanation to those viewing the
scenes. To the one hosting the mind-dive, it was a chance to confront
powerful and difficult facets of their backstory; a chance to explore
who their character had been and how they had gotten to who they had
become. To everyone else involved it was part puzzle, part theatre;
deeply surreal and impactful for all involved due to the clever use of
mechanics (trying to figure out what each object represented) and the
emotional stakes involved. Characters were literally playing with their
friends’ minds and memories and had to accept all repercussions for
their actions afterwards.

The immersion presented in the last couple of examples is different from
the more traditional examples above. The immersion created for the
players is created less by the representation of what the players are
doing and seeing and more in their buy-in of the scene. Typically, the
more emotionally driven a scene is, the more deeply a player can
empathize with their character. The very emotional scenes create a
special kind of resonance that allow characters to experience raw
emotion from their character’s perspective. This type of module is
heightened by the use of less concrete representation. As the intent is
to evoke strong reaction in the player, stripping away much of the
typical set dressing allows a more focused experience. The immersion
comes in from the strong emotion the players feel, allowing them to
become more immersed in their character’s headspace.

There are ways to add unique and interesting non-combat elements to more
traditional modules. The use of clever mechanics to represent puzzles or
other parts of the game can allow for very simulationist approaches to
non-combat roles. Putting effort into including complicated and
immersive non-combat facets in combat modules can round out immersion in
all parts of the game.

For example, *Rabbit Run* (Eddy et al.)[^9] uses a clever hacking
technique that is very resonant with the cyberpunk genre they are
embodying. While most of the game is very combat-heavy, there are some
characters who are focused on hacking, which is represented by tape set
up as circuits that the hackers must re-wire as combat rages around
them. It is interesting to observe their focus as they struggle to
finish the puzzle while fighting is happening all around them. They are
just as crucial as the fighters in these situations (perhaps more), and
the fact that the puzzles they are working on are physically
representative of what they are doing adds to the ease of immersion
already created by the emotional stakes.

*Occam’s Razor* (Darksteel Games)[^10] has a similarly impressive
representation of their technology. As a modern game with cyberpunk
elements, incorporating technology into their game is important to
maintain their genre. To this end, one of the staff members has written
small apps that can be installed on various devices and then interface
with receiver devices on modules. Hacking is simulated by an app with
various functions and puzzles that the players must solve to interface
with the technology. This creates an interesting split as, even when
these modules contain combat, hacker-type characters have tools given to
them by the staff that make them irreplaceable. The fact that the
puzzles are so evocative of the real world counterparts adds to the
ambience and allows the game to retain its immersive feeling.

Immersion is very important to boffer games. Working to include more
immersive non-combat modules is a sometimes tricky but ultimately
worthwhile goal. There seem to be a few key threads that weave through
non-combat modules that engage players and leave them feeling like
something from the module stayed with them.

One such commonality is emotional tie-in for the players. If there are
peace talks, the players must have strong feelings about a particular
outcome. If a non-player-character is the focus of the module, the
characters must have some emotional investment in that
non-player-character, be it firsthand or otherwise. The more narratively
built up a scene is, the more powerful the emotional payoff will be.
Making sure that players understand the consequences of their actions,
both in the short and long term, adds to the drama of the scene, the
emotional investment of the players, and the overall payout of the
scene.

The conceit must be given that most of the time, combat will still be an
option within any given scenario no matter the original intent. Part of
the freedom of boffer LARPs is that sometimes players will choose to
turn a non-combat module into a combat module by deciding that it is
time to begin attacking everyone. As the old adage says, no plot
survives contact with the players. Even in a module wherein a fight with
the guards of a vault should not be winnable, the guards should have
full stat blocks in case of player-character failure or
player-characters trying to push their luck. If there is no way for
peace talks to devolve into war, it will still heighten a scene if the
nobility in question have bodyguards to stand with them. It adds to the
illusion of the world and weaves a fuller and more realistic picture as
well as an edge of danger that will better grab players.

There are many players that just want to live in the world that the
staff have created. They like to explore, learn the stories and lives of
the non-player-characters they encounter, and learn as much of the world
background as they can. These types of players frequently enjoy
opportunities to immerse themselves in parts of the world and show off
their own personal skills. Giving players an opportunity to solve plots
with unique and unusual skills will add to their experience. Giving them
fleshed out non-player-characters to talk to and learn about the world
from will add entertainment that can’t necessarily be gained from just
combat.

It is important to remember that in these games, players frequently
consider violence to be their first option. It is seen by many as the
go-to solution to many kinds of problems. When a module is properly
configured and violence is removed as a possible solution, it forces
players to adapt or react in ways that can be very powerful. It is
sufficiently rare that creatures cannot be fought that such encounters
are memorable. Rendering a character who is normally very physically
inclined helpless, assuming that the player is fine with being in such a
state, can heighten the experience. Suddenly that character is forced to
struggle through figuring out another solution. This is one of the ways
to force a character to grow and confront parts of themselves they might
not normally engage with, and thus is a very powerful tool.

Working with these concepts can help push a non-combat module to the
next level, and help the players become immersed in the world that is
being created around them. The more commonly-accepted and talked about
such non-combat modules become, the more likely the community is to gain
players who are interested in things other than combat. Broadening the
appeal of live-combat games to include things other than live-combat
creates a more inclusive and accepting hobby as well as one with more
universal appeal. It helps draw in players with unique skillsets that
can help enhance the experiences of their fellows by bringing fresh
points of view and exciting new stories to tell. As writers and players,
we can and should embrace this direction of storytelling, blend it with
established conventions, and create exciting new adventures.
