<h2 class="document-separator">Organizer Presentation</h2>

These are a few notes that I’ve compiled after the game, for anyone that
would be interested in running it. This document concerns the first
version of the game, which was originally created for 16 students.

### Presentation

<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li>“Graveyard of the Sacrifice,” an Edularp about WWII, memory duty, the
building of History and survivors’ war stories</li>
  <li>Created by: Muriel Algayres</li>
  <li>Players: 16 (original run)</li>
  <li>Running time: about 6 hours</li>
  <li>Pre-game workshops: 3x45minutes</li>
  <li>Game time: about 2 hours</li>
  <li>Post-game workshop: 45 minutes</li>
</ul>

### Choice of design

The game was created as a narrativist approach to issues regarding World
War II, especially memory duty, the creation of History, and surviving
the war. I wanted to focus on survivors’ tales and the civilian
population’s experience of the war (which we usually address less
frequently in general classes).

The character design was a duplicate of the template that was created by
the Danish organization rollespilsfabrikken, with courteous
authorization on their part. It is a very practical format that enables
to give all the necessary information in a succinct way, while enabling
the players to get into character and make them their own.

### Running the game

These are the sequences I used for running the game. It should be noted
that I didn’t start with the game, I did it with second-year students,
who were trained in roleplaying exercises before, so were already
familiar with the process when I introduced the game. Starting with
shorter roleplaying exercises is, to me, very useful.

1. Game presentation, defining what the exercise is about, discussing
   costumes: where I give the students instructions, and also the
   presentation to the parents, get the necessary authorizations
2. Characters preparation: the students get the characters, have to read
   them. First workshop session where they discuss the characters, create
   connections, learn about the characters they’ll be playing
3. Memorial visit: for legal reasons, it was forbidden to do the visit in
   character. Any memorial site could be considered to run the game. Before
   the visit, I ask them to imagine what it would feel for their character,
   to visit that site.
4. Character preparation, second workshop: 45 minutes of roleplaying by
   groups of 4, according to their nationality. A good time to calibrate
   the roleplaying, to tone down the most energetic students so that they
   will leave room for the others, to encourage the shy ones.
5. The game: around a meeting or a picnic. The students discuss the
   memorial visit and the war, as their characters.
6. Exit workshop and debriefing: we make a circle, ask each student what
   they thought of the experience, how they feel. On an extra sequence, it
   is possible to play a last meeting of the characters, months later, and
   have them talk about what they’re doing with their life.

### The teacher’s role:

The teacher is present as Mr/Ms Green, the handler of the group. He
interviews the students so that they will each have an occasion to talk
and express themselves, even the more discreet ones. We can also
intervene to make sure all students remain in characters (there can be
the occasional slip or contemporary reference appearing, but it is best
in my opinion to put the student back on track in a discreet way). If
English is not the students first language, making sure they don’t
revert to their mother tongue is also part of the teacher’s work.

<h2 class="document-separator">Communication to the parents</h2>

The following document was originally written in French and used to
present the project to the parents. They were at the end asked to sign
their authorization for their children to be part of the project. On the
first run of the project, they all did. Instructions for costumes, which
I include there, were given to the students at the same time on a
separate paper.

### Presentation of the project « Graveyard of the sacrifice »

#### Coordinator:

Mme ALGAYRES, Professor « agrégé », History-Geography, teacher « DNL »,
History Geography in English (note : these are French titles. It means
that I have a double qualification, both for teaching History, with the
highest rank for secondary school teachers, and for the English practice
optional course)

#### Definition of the project

« Graveyard of the sacrifice » is an educational Larp for the 11^th^
grade. It was originally written for 16 students. It is an educational
project about memory duty, the construction of History, and survivors’
guilt.

#### What is Edu-Larp?

Edu-Larp is an abbreviation for *educational live action role playing
game,* used to describe all pratice using roleplaying as a performing
art for educational purpose.

This practice can be defined as a collective act of learning, through
the creation of a common narrative that develops students’
participation, attention, and social skills.

This activity can be defined as a form of improvisation theatre, with
the absence of any audience. The activity is based on freestyle
interaction between students, through their characters, that they all
build together.

This game is created in the European section, it will be written and
played entirely in English.

#### What is the purpose of Edu-Larp ?

Many researchers, Dr Sarah Lynne Bowman at the forefront, have shown the
interest of using improvisation and roleplaying as educational tools.
This practice enables developing many skills simultaneously and to learn
contents more easily.

In the European section, the Edu-Larp approach has an additional
advantage where language practice is concerned. For more timid or
self-conscious students, the character’s alibi represents a protection
against fear of failure. For students more comfortable with oral
practice, it is a way to learn more vocabulary, strenghten their
self-confidence and boost creativity.

Therefore, Edu-Larp can be considered as an innovative form of pedagogy,
which will enable us to explore content and work a thematic approach in
a deeper way (the duty of remembrance in this instance). It should be
noted that, if that practice is rare in France (and this experimentation
could be a first of its kind), it is more frequent in Nordic countries,
especially Denmark where it is regularly used in the primary circle.

### The project

This project will be built around the visit that has been organised
around the visit of a memorial site at Mont-Valerien (note: a site near
Paris where about a thousand Resistants and hostages were executed
during the German occupation of France). The visit will be used as a
background for the project.

The students will be asked to work on characters close to their own age,
students aged 16 to 18 in 1951. These characters will have lived through
the war years as children. The students will then have to transcribe the
visit using their character’s point of view, and present it has
historical fiction.

They will have to adopt both the inner and outer point of view, working
both on fiction and documentary research, to learn about the historical
fact, but also reflect on the population’s life experience. The purpose
of the exercise is to consider History and memory duty in a vivid
manner, analytically and empathically.

### Planning, costumes, authorization

Authorizations, planning and costume were then addressed in the original
document. Parents were asked to give permission for the game (as there
was a visit outside the school, it is mandatory to have an
authorization) and for me to use pictures that would be taken for the
communication around the game.

Some costumes could be provided if needed. In the end, most students
brought their own clothing, only 5 students were provided a full
costume.

* Male costume: retro appearance, basic shirt and vest, standard pants (no
jeans), leather shoes

* Female costume: dress or shirt and skirt, leather shoes.

<h2 class="document-separator">Presentation and instruction for the students</h2>

“Graveyard of the sacrifice” is an Edu-Larp about the duty of
remembrance, the teaching of History and survivor’s guilt after WWII. It
is created for 16 players as a template for reflecting about WWII and
English practice.

### What is Edularp?

Edularp stands for educational Live action Role playing. Larp is an
activity where all participants create a common fictional situation
through the interpretation of characters. It as bit like an
improvisational theatre, only with no audience except the participants
themselves.

For this exercise, it is useful to get us to discuss more easily in
English, and work about topics regarding the war trying to adopt a
different point of view.

### The setting

The year is 1951. The war has been over for 6 years, and European
rebuilding is under way. On the 9^th May 1950, the Schuman declaration
proposes the establishment of a supranational community in Europe. It is
followed by the treaty of Paris on the 18^th^ of April 1951 that founds
the European Coal and Steel Community.

Your characters are high school students aged 16 to 18 at most. They
only have childhood memories of the war, but though they were too young
to be involved in the military or actual fighting, they have actual
memories of the war, the Nuremberg trials, and the harsh years following
the war. They have known deprivation and food shortages, having to clean
up the street, and walk to school among the rumble.

Though their scolarity has been disturbed by the war, they have caught
up with their studies, and are now considered to be all good, or even
exceptional students. They have been selected for a European writing
competition financed by the council of Europe. Coming from the founding
countries of the united Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium,
Luxemburg, the Netherlands), they must visit a war memorial together (in
our example, at Suresnes) and then write about their experience. The
best writings are to be selected and published in an upcoming memoir of
war stories recollections, which could be a great opportunity for most.
Aspiring writers, journalists or politicians among the students are
aware of the remembrance duty at that time, but also of the good
opportunities that might arise for them, should their own text be
published.

The students have arrived in groups of 4 from each country the day
before (the Benelux group starting as a single group from Brussels).
Some have undergone the selection process together, but most don’t know
each other yet.

### How will it work?

The students will get a week and two hours preparation time in class to
learn about their character and define them. Specific workshops will be
used to help them flesh out their character’s story and get into
characters. You will get a specific document regarding costuming. Some
clothing will be provided by the organization, if needed.

The visit will be done out of character, but you will afterwards imagine
it as your character might have experienced it.

Language will be English and English only. Even students playing
French-speaking characters should refrain from speaking French, if only
for politeness reasons.

After the game, there will be a proper debriefing time. Then students
will be required to write a paper on the visit from their character’s
point of view (as if it was to be submitted for the context, as stated
by the setting description). These papers will be graded for the year’s
final term.

Over the course of the game, pictures might be taken to document the
game process. They will be used only for private use and academic
documentation, and only with the families’ authorization

### Registration to the writing context and writing instruction

You have registered for the Council of Europe writing contest of 1951
about war memorials and the duty of remembrance. You will have to
submit, by the end of the month, a 500–1000 words summary of your visit
and experience. You might add testimonies that you have gathered along
the way. Keep your descriptions as personal as possible. Try to answer
the following questions in your opinion:

* Why is the duty of remembrance so important for us?
* What role should war memorials play in this regard?
* How do you feel the European construction can be an answer to the need for peace in Europe?

### Prepping for character

1. Answer the 5 questions on your character sheet
2. Find 1–5 more things that you could do during the course of the game (different from the first 5 suggestions on your character sheet)
3. Class exercise: discuss with other characters of the same country and research the situation of the country or area your character was in during the war. How did the character live their experience of the war? (France, Germany, Italy, Benelux)
4. Class exercise: discuss characters by type (Resistant, Collaborator, War victim). Which aspect do you think should be discussed during the game?
5. Calibration exercise: enact the first day of the writing contest and each character’s meeting with the others (from the same country).

**Nationality:** Dutch<br/>

### Description

You were born to a very ancient Dutch family, your family is descended
from a long line of international traders. But war divided your parents.
When Germany invaded, your father was close to the government that
wanted to collaborate with Germany. He was among the few that believed
that the Netherlands would be considered as an Aryan nation too. Your
father was very arrogant on that subject, and quite racist, he believed
that he, along with a minority of the Dutch population, had their place
as a “superior race”. He worked a lot with Germany, trading goods, and
made a lot of money.

However, most of the population didn’t believe that, because the
Netherlands were created as a humanist and free country when Europe was
mostly absolute monarchies. Your mother especially wanted to oppose the
hold of Germany on the country. They had a lot of fights together. They
were hard years for you, always hearing your father yelling at each
other, and suffering from hunger in the final years of the war.

And then your mother was caught actively resisting the German occupation
and executed among other people considered as traitors. You were
horribly shocked at this. You fought with your father, blaming him for
your mother’s death. You were so furious when you heard the news that
you left home, going in the streets past curfew time. Of course, you
were arrested by a police patrol and got a severe beating. Fortunately,
the police knew that your father was working with the government and let
him take you back home. You realize that you were lucky, that you could
have died. The idea is enough to make you tremble.

After that incident, you were mostly locked at home until the end of the
war. Your father wouldn’t let you out. You’re barely talking to him
anymore, the situation has been very tense since your mother’s death.
After the war you resumed your studies, but you are not very interested.
You have difficulties finding hope and a reason to live. The only solace
you’ve found is being part of an artist group that defends pacifism and
antimilitarism. You were even part of an international meeting of young
artists in Switzerland last year. In that aspect, the project of
European construction is particularly interesting to you.

From your artist group you heard about the writing contest, and decided
to join, if only to escape your home and the heavy silence that exists
between you and your father, which is almost unbearable these days. You
want to write to talk about your mother, and losing loved ones to the
war, finding a way to live after all that.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are generally positive and try to see the good in
everyone. In your opinion, everyone can make mistakes and be vulnerable
someday, and deserves a second chance. You can be a positive influence
on others

**Dark Side:** you are still shocked after being arrested and beaten by
the police, and can suffer from episodes of depression. You are still
angry over your mother’s death, you hold your father responsible,
haven’t forgiven him for that. Because of that, collaborators with
Germany are particularly hateful to you, even worse than the German
themselves

### Questions

1. Do you feel you can ever forgive your father for supporting Germany, and letting your mother be executed?
2. What do you see yourself becoming in a couple of years? Do you want to study, have a career, have a family?
3. Do you have any friends in the group? Who do you feel the closest to?
4. What are your beliefs? Are you religious? Do you belong to a political organization?
5. What do you want for the European construction? How do you think a hope for peace can be achieved?

### What to do?

1. Tell about life in the Netherlands during the war, the occupation, lack of food, violence against the population. Express anger that some people (like your father) believed in the Nazi ideal of the superior race, even if they were a minority.
2. Interview other participants to find ideas for your articles. Focus on other people who like you were victims of violence, or lost close relatives.
3. Tell someone about your mother’s death, and express genuine sadness at her loss.
4. Find another participant that seems sad or broken by war, and try to find arguments to make them hope in the future
5. Decide whether you’ll try to forgive your father once your home of if you’ll leave your family to move to another place (going to the United States, maybe?)

### Relationships

* V. Mozzato: an Italian participant and another young artist
* R. Willensee: a participant from Luxembourg that comes from a wealthy family in the banking system
* F. and T. Labbet: siblings from Belgium, with very different personalities, and who seems to have grown apart during the war

<h2 class="document-separator">R. Willensee</h2>

**Nationality:** Luxembourgian<br/>
**Type:** Collaborator<br/>
**Age:** Young (16–18 yrs)<br/>
**Profession:** Student<br/>
**Group:** Benelux<br/>
**Keywords:** cynical, detached, unsympathetic, survivor

### Description

You were born to a wealthy family that own one of the great banks in
Luxembourg. Your father as well as your brother work in finance. When
Luxembourg was invaded by the German and a military government was
established, business didn’t change much. The Bank, as you well know,
doesn’t care about affiliation or ideologies. Luxembourg was such a
small country, it had to carefully maintain a semblance of neutrality.
So your family worked both with the Allies and the Germans, usually
through assets in Switzerland, a country that generally remained
neutral.

Life in Luxembourg was usually not that hard. Everything that was of
Franch origin, names, places, had to be removed to please the German
invaders. Since your family is of Flemish origin, your name was pleasing
to them, and you were generally well-treated. You suffered from
shortages of food and the occasional roughness of the soldiers, but you
know you had it better than most people. Like the rest of your family,
you learned a lot about politeness and hypocrisy. People needed the
Banks working, so as long as your family was making money, you were
generally left in peace.

You knew about persecution and deportation, of course. The Jewish
population of Luxembourg wasn’t spared. Some people pretend they
couldn’t possibly know about it, you find that they were either naïve or
stupid, how is it possible, not to have seen it? You knew, but you
didn’t care, it was none of your concern, you were glad that your family
was generally spared.

You are quite ambitious and are not sure you want to make all your
career in the bank. So the writing contest was an opportunity to you to
show your writing skills, it might be useful if you decide to try your
hand at journalism or politics. Again, you’re not sure about what you
want to do with your life, but you’re sure you’ll succeed if you want
to.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are ambitious, self-confident and determined. You
are not afraid to express your opinion, even if they might shock or hurt
people a bit. You like to think unconventionally and question people’s
beliefs, even if you might have to play the Devil’s advocate for that

**Dark Side:** you can be cynical and unsympathetic. To you, people who
dwell on their past suffering miss on the opportunity to build their
future. You can therefore be quite harsh while dealing with other
people. Perhaps you just have never confronted these issues directly.

### Questions

1. What was the hardest thing that you lived or experienced during the war? Compare with other people’s hardest experiences
2. How do you feel about the critic against the banks who helped hide Nazi money and assets after the war? Do you agree with them, or find them unfair?
3. Have you made any friends within the rest of the group? Who do you feel the closest to?
4. What is your opinion about the European construction? Do you think it is a good opportunity for peace? For business?
5. What do you feel about the war crimes and violence of the war? Are you shocked? Horrified? Indifferent?

### What to do?

1. Tell people about the history of Luxembourg during the war and the military occupation
2. Interview the other participants to find ideas for your article. Focus on the civilian populations that had to collaborate with Germany
3. Defend the idea that Banks (or business in general) should not mind the ideology of people they work with, and that the banking industry has to keep working even during war time
4. Listen to people tell about their war stories, and express some sympathy towards their suffering (even if it is just to be polite)
5. Decide whether you’ll be shocked by the horrors of the war, or will just remain indifferent

### Relationships

* P. Ebert: a German participant whose family was high ranking in the Nazi party. They have hidden money in your bank in Luxembourg
* E. Vandereyden: a participant from the Netherlands, that seems to have bad memories from the war
* F. and T. Labbet: siblings from Belgium, with very different personalities, and who seems to have grown apart during the war

### Description

You and your twin sibling T. (you’re false twins) were born to a single
mother. You never knew who your father was, they had an affair but he
left her upon discovering she was pregnant. It was quite common before
the war. Your mother worked hard to make sure you and your twin wouldn’t
lack anything, but it was hard, and it became harder after the war.

When the war started, Belgium was occupied by the German military. The
whole country was exploited. Your mother worked in a weapons factory, it
was hard to make ends meet. Both your twin and you started roaming the
street to find menial jobs in exchange for food.

You started working with people on the black market. You would be a
lookout for German patrols, carry messages or crates, all sorts of
things. After a while people starting noticing you, and asked if you
would carry messages for the Resistance. It was dangerous, but working
the Black Market could also get you arrested, and the compensations
given by the Resistance were good. You didn’t feel that strongly towards
them, you just wanted to eat, but after a while it felt good to resist
the German invasion.

So you started carrying messages around and spying the German troops. As
a kid, you could go where adults would be shot on sight. You started to
feel proud about what you were doing, even though you try not to brag
about it. Thanks to your contacts with the Resistance, you managed to
warn a few families in your neighborhood about German patrols, probably
saved a few families too. They were small actions, but it was better
than staying passive and doing nothing.

After the war your name was quoted among the youngest resistants ever.
You might get a citation for that. You also was offered an opportunity
to be part of the writing contest, because they think your experience
would be valuable. You feel thay might exaggerate a bit, but you’re
still glad to be part of the project. Your twin decided to register with
you. You’re also glad you’re in this together, you grew apart a bit
during the war, it is time you got close again.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are more experienced and mature than most people
your own age, but you don’t brag about it. You always try to do what
feels right to you, you are very moral in most instances. You also try
to help others if you find an opportunity to do so

**Dark Side:** you are very discreet and exceedingly modest, to the
point of not admitting to your own accomplishment. You feel that you
should not be afraid to express more pride in your abilities, but you
are always afraid of other people’s opinion, that they might find you
arrogant. You need to find a better balance in your life.

### Questions

1. When were you the most afraid as you were helping the Resistance? Were you ever in any risk of being arrested and found out?
2. You and your twin have grown apart during the war, do you feel sad about it? Do you want to find a way to mend your relationship?
3. What did you feel when the Nazi war crimes were revealed to the world? How did you react to the horror of it?
4. What do you feel about the European construction? Do you see it as an actual hope for peace in Europe?
5. What do you wish for your future? Do you have any ambitions? Would you like to become a journalist?

### What to do?

1. Tell other people about the life in Belgium under the military occupation by Germany and the hardship inflicted upon the population
2. Tell about your stories with the Resistance. Try to be modest about it.
3. Find someone that suffers from bad memories of the war and try to help them by giving them reasons to hope in the future.
4. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article. Focus on people whose family were also involved with the resistance.
5. Talk more to your twin to see if you can get close again, like when you were little

### Relationships

* T. Labbet: your sibling, with a very different personality. You seem to have grown apart during the war
* E. Vandereyden: a participant from the Netherlands, that seems to have bad memories from the war
* R. Willensee: a participant from Luxembourg that comes from a wealthy family in the banking system

### Description

You and your twin sibling F. (you’re false twins) were born to a single mother. You never knew who your father was, they had an affair but he left her upon discovering she was pregnant. It was quite common before the war. Your mother worked hard to make sure you and your twin wouldn’t lack anything, but it was hard, and it became harder after the war.

When the war started, Belgium was occupied by the German military. The whole country was exploited. Your mother worked in a weapons factory, it was hard to make ends meet. Both your twin and you started roaming the street to find menial jobs in exchange for food.

You did what seemed quite logical at the time: you went to the
authorities to see what job opportunities they could offer. The German
occupation was bad, but they needed support with the population. You
found some sympathetic people among the military government. You
accepted to carry messages around in exchange for food, and to help find
information. The Germans wanted to know where Jewish families and
Resistant could be hiding, and you got a few families to talk and
provide valuable information that were very well paid.

Of course, you sometimes felt guilty over collaborating this way, but it
was the only way to get food without running the risk of being arrested.
You were sometimes scared for your twin, you knew they’d go to the Black
Market, which was a dangerous place. You were both busy trying to
survive and did not talk much about what you went through during the
war, even though it must have been hard on the both of you.

Now the war has ended and it is difficult to resume life as it was
before. F. seems to adjust better than you. It is through F. that you
heard about the writing contest, and you decided to go along with them,
maybe it is a chance for the both of you to get close again.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are determined and strong-willed, when you really
want something you will do everything in your power to get it. You can
put up with critics or mean people and ignore them, what is important to
you is your own opinion and will to survive

**Dark Side:** you are quite selfish and worry first about yourself. You
only appreciate the company of people who think like you and appreciate
you. You tend to dismiss critics because you would feel hurt by
accepting them. This can lead you to be harsh and aggressive towards
other people

### Questions

1. Are you ashamed that you helped the German troops during the military occupation? Do you feel guilty over it?
2. You and your twin have grown apart during the war, do you feel sad about it? Do you want to find a way to mend your relationship?
3. What did you feel when the Nazi war crimes were revealed to the world? How did you react to the horror of it?
4. Have you made friends with the rest of the group? Who do you feel the closest to?
5. What do you feel about the European construction? Do you see it as an actual hope for peace in Europe?

### What to do?

1. Tell other people about the life in Belgium under the military occupation by Germany and the hardship inflicted upon the population
2. Admit to helping with the German occupation and try to justify yourself by saying that your main preoccupation was to survive
3. Find other people whose families had to work with the Nazis to see if they share your point of view
4. Feel remorse about helping during the military occupation, and find someone to talk about feeling sometimes guilty
5. Talk more to your twin to see if you can get close again, like when you were little

### Description

You were born to a wealthy and influential family. Most men in your
family are involved in politics, on the conservative right. Your mother
died of illness before the war, when you were very young, you don’t
remember much of her. Your father was always busy with work, so you were
left mostly alone with a governess. It was really lonely. You wish you
had siblings, but you are an only child.

When France was invaded by the Germans and the country collapsed, you
moved to the city of Vichy with your father, because he was part of the
new government. You lost contact with all your friends, except your
cousin, M. (Gillet), who still lived in Paris, and wrote to you about
how hard life was up there. In Vichy, life was pretty quiet up until the
final invasion by Germany in 1943. From here the last two years were
hard, but you were protected by your father’s high ranking position.

Your father trained you in politics from an early age, and you have
always well understood why France had been undergoing a crisis and lost
in the summer of 1940. Low demographics, lazy behavior in your
countrymen had led to defeat. The country had been driven to ruins by
communists, anarchists, the Jews and the Freemasons. It was obvious that
France needed a strong government to get out of the crisis, and could
have found it by collaborating with the Germans.

When Germany lost the war and the new government was established, your
father quickly found a new place in the new administration. You went
back to live in Paris and now stay at your aunt’s place, your father’s
sister, who is now a widow, and your cousin M. A lot of former people
from the Vichy regime became part of the government of the new Republic,
their skills are too precious to go to waste. Life is hard, however,
there is still a lack of food and a lot of deprivation. Although you
have resumed your studies, you and your cousin spend a lot of time out
looking for food, using food stamps provided by the administration. You
are also fed up with people who are ranting against Vichy and
cooperation. Don’t they realize people were just trying to get France
out of the crisis? The socialist government brought them the defeat, it
wasn’t great either. You’ve also witnessed violence from the population
and from the invading soldiers, the Allies were hardly better than some
of the German troops in that regard. History is just the way people see
it, in your opinion.

You heard about the writing contest and decided to join. You thought
that maybe you could shed some light from what happened on the Vichy
side of thing, how collaboration was at the time a necessary evil, and
at least make people understand how the situation was more complicated
than they could envision it. Your father encouraged you to join, he
thinks your being part of it could be great as a starting point to your
eventual future political career. You convinced your cousin to join too,
M. was a bit reluctant at first, but finally joined too, it’s nice for
you to have them along.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are well-educated, polite, self-confident, and
really ambitious. You can easily imagine having a political career ahead
of you. You are patient, and with your good communication skills, you
can take the time necessary to get people on your side, they’ll
eventually get swayed by your persuasion.

**Dark Side:** you are so confident that you are easily convinced that
you are always right, and can be dismissive of other people’s opinions.
You are proud of your good upbringing, and a bit arrogant. You can
easily lack empathy to other people’s sufferings.

### Questions

1. Why are you convinced that collaboration with Germany was a necessity, or even a good thing? Define how your education and life during the war gave you these ideas?
2. What are your relationships with your cousin M.? Are you really close? Or are you forced to spend a lot of time together because of your circumstances?
3. Have you made friends with other people in the group? Who do you feel the closer to?
4. What are your beliefs? Are you religious?
5. Do you follow the same branch of politics as your father, or would you consider joining the Gaullists?
6. Do you think that the European construction is a good thing and a real hope for peace in Europe, or a utopic project, doomed from the start?

### What to do?

1. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article.
2. Tell about life in France after the war, the hardship and food shortages, the occasional violence from American soldiers. People should know that your people by no means have it easy.
3. If someone tells too much about their suffering, get bored, tell them off and to man up a little. You can’t stand people that always complain about themselves.
4. Defend the idea that the Vichy regime did a few good things, and was the only hope to save France at the time.
5. Question your own convictions: did you really believe in collaboration with Germany, or is it mostly your father’s opinion rubbing on you?

### Description

You are probably one of the few among your age group that has seen
actual fighting. Well, you weren’t directly fighting, but were very near
the combat zones.

Your family are hardcore communists, and so are you. You believe in
equality for the masses and the power of revolution. You admire what the
USSR tries to build and how brave the Russian people were in the face of
invasion. People in France praise mostly the American, but you feel it
unfair that people should forget that Russia actually suffered the most
casualties in the war.

You are the youngest of three. Your elder brother fought in Spain, went
to London in June 1940 to join the General de Gaulle (which made your
parents furious because they didn’t find him fit to lead the
Resistance). This enabled him to join the Allied troops, which liberated
Paris in August 1944, and he even was part of the troops that entered
Germany, going as far as Berlin. He’s still stationed there. He’s a true
hero of the Resistance, you admire him immensely.

Your parents and middle brother joined the Resistance very early on. You
lived the war years in hiding. Your family took part in sabotage
missions, then in actual fighting during the liberation. You and the
younger kids were kept behind the lines, of course, but you helped,
carrying messages, tending to the wounded, bringing food and water to
the soldiers. You saw a lot of people die. It was hard at first, and you
still have occasional nightmares over it. At the same time, you wish
you’d been old enough to join the fight.

In the end of the war, when the fighting got really ugly, some of the
Resistant fighters were captured and executed as hostages, your father
among them. You were very much broken over it, you loved your father
very much. Even though peace has been signed, you still hate the Germans
for it. You know the horrible war crimes they committed. Likewise, you
have the French collaborators, the French “Milice” killed a lot of
family friends in the Resistance. Your family was ever brave with strong
convictions, and they fought and paid the price for it. People who lack
that courage, in your opinion, are just weak-minded cowards.

Life in France is still hard after the war. Food is scarce. There is
still the occasional violence in the streets. However, most of the
people who worked with the Vichy regime are now working for the new
Republic. It is as if people were trying to forget about collaboration,
no one really talks about it.

So when you heard about the writing contest, you decided to join. You
want to denounce the collaboration in France and the war crimes, so that
they should not be forgotten.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are energetic, passionate, and eager to express your
opinion. You sincerely defend the idea of equality between people, men
and women, different classes. You are against racism, which is still
rare for your time, and against colonization. You have a lot of energy
and can be convincing while talking to people.

**Dark Side:** you were involved with the Resistance, so you are very
hard against people who didn’t take a clear position during the war.
Passive collaborators, supporters of fascism, they are all the same to
you: cowards who did nothing while people like your father got killed to
defend their beliefs and freedom. You can be aggressive on these issues.

### Questions

1. Did you like your life hiding in the mountain with the Resistance, being in the open and near the fights? Or did you suffer a lot from the hardship, fear of being arrested, of violence and death?
2. Do you sincerely believe in the communist ideals, or do you follow them because all your family, and especially your father, have always followed them?
3. Do you believe that the European construction can be an actual hope for peace, or that it will probably fail?
4. Have you made any friends with the rest of the group? Who would you feel the closer to?
5. Where do you see yourself in a couple of years? Do you want to study? Have a career? A family?

### What to do?

1. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article.
2. Sing a revolutionary song (see “l’Internationale”) or read a communist text (from “*The Communist Manifesto”* for example)
3. Denounce violently the fascists and collaborators, and tell somebody off if they try to defend a different point of view
4. Express sadness and anger over the way your father was executed with other resistants
5. Try to convince other participants to join the Communists Youths. You can have a lot of fun there.

### Relationships

**Keywords:** Resistant, brave, selfless, energetic

### Description

Resisting the German occupation was hard, but you found a way to do it.
Few children were involved with the Resistance, but you were one of the
few.

You were born to a Jewish family in the South of France. So you were
part of the free zone, but your heard tales of deportation and it was
scary. Your family was not very religious, but you knew you could get
arrested at any time. You suffered from lack of food and having to hide
for fear of being arrested. You had very difficult childhood years.
Since you had to hide a lot, you couldn’t make many friends.

It was a bit better when your cousin G. (Ferro) and his father came to
live with you. They had escaped fascism in Italy (G.’s mother was
Italian, she died in Italy), to settle in France. G. also has a sister
who stayed in Italy, to fight with the rebels. However, after the final
invasion of the free zone by Germany, your father and uncle were both
arrested and deported. They never came back, probably died along the
way. Now there is only you, your mother and your cousin alive.

You mother started being even more overprotective with you, on top of
your being and only child. But after losing your father you wanted to do
something useful. You managed to find, thanks to your family
housekeeper, people involved with the Resistance. You offered to help.
You were used to pass messages, hidden in your bike, or to go near
German troops to spy on their equipment. As a kid, you could go
unsuspected where adults would have been shot on sight. You were only 12
at that time, you knew that you were a little reckless, but each time
you thought of your father and it got you going.

Being near the Resistance got you more and more interested in communism,
a lot of the freedom fighters were communists who opposed the racist
fascist ideology, but you don’t know if you would like to get into
politics just yet.

Now the war has ended. Life is still hard, you spend a lot of time with
your cousin hunting for food. You have seen a lot of violence during the
liberation of the country, especially women with their head being shorn
off, it shocked your cousin a lot. You are more indifferent. Risking
your life gave you a different perspective. Actually, you find life a
bit boring now. When you were a Resistant, each day was thrilling. Now
it’s just classes every day and having to help rebuilding the country.

When your cousin heard about the writing contest and wanted to join, you
decided to do the same. You haven’t told anyone about being a child
resistant. You kept it a secret, but now you want to tell about your
experience, maybe relive a little of it in writing.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are very mature for your age, having developed
survival skills at an early age. You are attentive, quick-thinking,
determined. You can find words to help, advice and comfort people quite
easily, you also are a good listener

**Dark Side:** since the end of the war, you find yourself bored. If you
don’t find something to do, you get restless and irritated. You find
people of your own age a bit childish, and would easily brag about your
daring actions helping the Resistance

### Questions

1. Did you take the time to properly mourn your parents, or are you still in denial over the suffering their deaths caused you?
2. How do you feel about your cousin G.? Have you become really closed, or do you keep apart and prefer not to get too close?
3. Your parents were not very religious people, do you feel the same? Do you want to be religious? Would you rather invest in politics? Or do you prefer having no ideology at all?
4. What do you feel towards people who followed fascism? Do you hate them? Despise them? Do you think the Nuremberg trial were enough to give justice to the populations who suffered?
5. Do you think that the European construction is a good hope for peace?

### What to do?

1. Tell people about the hardships endured by the French population, during and after the war.
2. Tell about your helping the Resistance. Boast a little about it, after all, very few people actually helped the Resistance at such a young age.
3. When people dying are mentioned, get sad over your father and uncle’s deportation and death. Express anger against fascism and racism, the ideologies that got so many people killed.
4. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article. Focus on those whose families were also resisting fascism.
5. Find another participants that has issues with the war, is feeling sad or downhearted, and find good words to comfort and cheer them up

### Description

You were born and lived in Paris your entire life, so you saw a lot of
the German invasion and occupation. Your family was generally safe: you
were not Jewish, and on your mother’s side, you have a few important
politicians that were huge with the government of Vichy. So generally
speaking, you suffered less from food shortages and deprivation. Life
went on. Of course, you saw people being arrested, but that was part of
the war and the occupation.

Your mother and father believed that the German occupation was a lesser
evil, if not for the Vichy government, you would have the communists
taking over, and that would be the ruin of the country. So you had to
learn to put up with the occupation, and it could have been worse.

When Paris was besieged, your father was drafted with a lot of the able
bodied men to fight in the defense of the city. He got killed there,
probably by a stray bullet. He didn’t even want to fight, he was
probably at the wrong place at the wrong time. This is true for most
people during the war. Your brother was sent in Germany for mandatory
work (the STO), he was lucky to be host with a decent family. He just
came back, and it is hard for him, people who were in Germany are
usually despised by the rest of the population. He works now with a bank
based in Luxemburg.

After the war your uncle, your mother’s brother, and your cousin O.
(Georges) came to live with you in Paris. Your uncle had been an
important man in the Vichy government and was employed by the new
Republic, skills like his are too important to go to waste. In spite of
the fact that your family have money and connections, times are hard,
and you and your cousin have to spend quite some time searching for
food.

You have read a lot about the war since it ended. Only then have you
learned about war crimes, the collaboration, deportation of Jewish
people. You were very shocked by what you heard, the vision of the
German death camps. You never knew. You guess most of the population
never knew. You feel guilty that you, like most people, didn’t even
think about it. And yet you saw people being arrested every day, you
should have known.

You feel uneasy about the fact that, in France, no one seems to talk
about collaboration and the problems that the country had. Of course,
life must go on and we must rebuild the country, but you feel like the
duty of memory is unfulfilled somehow. Your cousin feels quite
differently of course, claiming that collaboration was inevitable, a
necessary evil to save the country at the time.

Then your cousin decided to join the writing contest, and enticed you to
do the same. You were reluctant at first but finally gave in. Perhaps,
if you get to write, you can put some words on the guilty feeling that
you have and that you still can quite explain.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are serious, hard-working, organized. You are
helpful whenever you can be, quite altruistic, attentive to the others.
Although you have been really depressed since the end of the war, you
are usually positive, trying to see the best in everything and the good
in people. You want to hope in the future

**Dark Side:** you don’t have a lot of confidence in yourself. You tend
to hide behind others if you can, and can miss on opportunities because
of that. Since the end of the war you have been depressed and gloomy, to
you the war is proof of how fallible human beings are

### Questions

1. Why didn’t you resent the German occupation or rebel against it? Was it out of fear, cowardice, ignorance of what was really at stake?
2. What are your relationships with your cousin O.? Are you really close?
3. Have you made any friends within the group? Who would you feel the closest to?
4. What are your beliefs? Are you religious? What would be your political affiliation, if you have one?
5. Do you believe the European construction can be a real hope for peace? What would you wish for the future?

### What to do?

1. Tell about the daily life in Paris under the occupation.
2. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article. Focus on people who just went through the war as civilians, and couldn’t do much except endure their daily lives
3. Express guilt over the fact that you, like most people, never guessed about the horrors of the war crimes
4. Express sadness over your father’s death. If necessary, isolate yourself for a while from the rest of the group.
5. Find someone else who feels sad or broken over their experience of the war and try to comfort them and cheer them up.

### Relationships

* O. Georges: your cousin. His immediate family was involved with the collaboration.
* J. Combes: another French participant and an extreme communist. His brother was in the army and fought against Germany
* S. Morin: another participant from France, who can sound very aggressive in their speech

### Description

Your parents were determined marxists and so are you. As such, your life
has been all but easy. When you were a child, your parents told you how
they tried to fight against the rise of the Nazis, up until the burning
of the Reichstag. Then they were arrested, did some time in jail. They
got married anyway, but once the Nazis were in charge they had to endure
one vexation after the other. They decided not to leave Germany, to keep
fighting no matter what. They were arrested and deported again, and you
were left in the care of your grandparents, who did not approve of your
parents radical opinions and reckless behavior. All things considered,
you admired them, but felt that you could never live up to such
determination and accomplishment. And sometimes you felt that your
parents were not always there for you, and resented them for that.

You had an unconventional childhood, for example, you never really went
to school and were homeschooled because your parents didn’t want you to
hear the Nazi propaganda. You spent some time in the Hitlerjugend
because it was mandatory, but you felt the people here were really
stupid and believed a lot of bullshit propaganda. You are quite proud to
have always been smarter than the rest of the population.

When the war ended, you fell on some really hard times. You had to
suffer ceaseless bombings and the invasion by the Allied soldiers. Then
there were the soldiers’ violence and denazification. Although your
family, as resistants, were amongst the one who rejoiced of the end of
nazism, all the population was treated the same, and there was no
difference between you and the former Nazis. I felt really unfair at
times.

When you learnt about the writing contest, you were one of the first to
apply. You felt like you really had a story to tell, you wanted to tell
the world that not all Germans were Nazis, and celebrate your parents’
legacy. You don’t care much for the rest of the German contestants, they
are very much what the rest of the population was at the time of the
war: ignorant, frightened, and following the regime like a bunch of
sheep. However, you are determined to win.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are determined, energetic, self-confident, and
striving to succeed. You are very efficient and, when set to a task, you
do all in your power to do it well. You have few friends outside of your
communist comrades, but for those, you are a very loyal and supportive
companion.

**Dark Side:** you have strong ideas and convictions, which makes you
judgmental to other people who do not share your beliefs. You divide the
world between the resistant and the others, and can be very mean towards
people you judge as cowards. If so, you can become very spiteful and
arrogant.

### Questions

1. Are your parents dead in captivity or did they come back from the camps? What are your feelings towards them?
2. Germany has been military occupied and is now divided between West and East Germany. How do you feel about the situation? Do you still have friends or relatives in the East?
3. Do you really believe in communism, or are you just following the ideology out of fidelity to your parents’ beliefs?
4. Have you made any friends in the rest of the group? If so, who are you the closest with? If not, why is it so?
5. Where do you see yourself in the future? Do you want to have a career? Do you want to have a family later, have children?

### What to do?

1. Defend the ideal of communism to the others of the group
2. Sing a communist song with other comrades in the group (might be the French version of “l’Internationale”
3. Find someone you fancy in the group and make them a sincere compliment
4. Interview another member of the group about their experience of the war to pick ideas for your article
5. Relate harsh memories of the civilian bombings of German cities and get sad over it

### Description

Your history is that of many people over Germany. Your parents were
simple people, they owned a grocery store in a small town by the Rhine
River. You weren’t particularly racist or Jew-haters, your parents
supported the Christian democrats. But when the Nazis came into power
you had to follow the new rules like anyone else. As a very small German
middle-class family, you were left generally in peace by the new regime,
as long as you followed the rules. So as a kid you were part of the
Hitlerjugend and learnt the propaganda of the regime at school. It is
true that the closing of all the Jewish shops, for a while, brought your
parents a new flux of customers, and your father was almost saying that
maybe the Führer had it right and knew what was best for Germany. You
weren’t so sure yourself. You had school friends who were persecuted or
had to leave. It seemed quite unfair to you, but you didn’t know what to
say about it.

Then the war came and it was dark times. Your older siblings were
conscripted to the army and to support the war effort, but fortunately
not your parents, who were already too old for that. The official news
on the radio claimed that everything was going well, but people believed
it less and less. There were shortages of food. Fortunately, your
hometown was too small to be of much interest to the armies, so you
suffered little from bombings.

The fall of the regime came as a shock. You didn’t know that things had
been so bad. You discovered the German defeats long after the war. You
were drafted with your parents to clear the rubble and clear the road.
Only then did you see a dead body for the first time. It was shocking,
but it still felt unreal.

Your town was relatively spared a lot of soldier violence, again, you
were fortunate to be out of the main roads. Then there was
denazification and the reveal of the extermination camps and mass murder
and Jews and others. To your family it came as a shock. You never knew,
of course you never knew. Or did you? Of course, in hindsight, there
were arrests, people disappearing, and rumors. They had started with the
handicapped, then taken the rest. People knew there were camps, but
extermination to that extent, no, no one could have guessed. But you
were of the people who had done nothing. You felt a dreadful guilt. So
have your parents. Your father had turned to alcoholism to cope, and
your mother barely speaks these days.

So when you heard about the memorial visit and the writing contest, you
applied at once. Anything to get out of the gloomy atmosphere of your
house. You were glad to be selected.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** in spite of your guilt and the horrors of the war, you
are still light-hearted and hopeful and want to believe in a better
future. You are generally pleasing around people even if you are not
very confident about yourself, you don’t have many difficulties to
connect with people

**Dark Side:** you are still very guilty, like most of the German
people. How could you fail to realize how bad the Nazi ideology was? You
feel like a coward, and this takes you to long periods of depression and
melancholy

### Questions

1. What did your older siblings become? Did they die during the war, or did they come back? What relationships do you have with them?
2. Germany has been military occupied and is now divided between West and East Germany. How do you feel about the situation? Do you still have friends or relatives in the East?
3. Now that Nazism is gone, do you have something to believe in? Are you religious, political? If not, why?
4. Have you made any friends in the rest of the group? If so, who are you the closest with? If not, why is it so?
5. Where do you see yourself in the future? Do you want to have a career? Do you want to have a family later, have children?

### What to do?

1. Make an interview of another participant to get ideas for your article
2. Complain about the difficulties of the war, the loss and rationing
3. Defend the fact that most of the German population couldn’t have known about the Nazis’ war crimes
4. Feel guilty again and isolate yourself from the rest of the group for a while
5. Find a friend among the group you could confess your guilt to

### Description

You really had it bad during the war although you don’t like to talk
much about it. Somehow you feel like you deserve it. Your family were
really strong supporters of the Nazi regime. It seemed legitimate at the
time. They believed that Germany needed a strong power to get out of the
crisis. They didn’t care much for the Jews, the communists and other
parasites. And in a way, you felt that they were right. You were part of
the Hitlerjugend and felt good there, you had friends and something to
believe in. Of course, all your siblings and family members old enough
to fight were taken in with the army. You even had a cousin in the SS,
the pride of the family.

Then Germany started to lose the war, even though the news on the radio
didn’t admit to it. In February 1945, as you still wanted to believe the
war could be won, your home city of Dresden was bombed. Your father was
killed, along with more than 20 000 people. While your mother was busy
grieving, you left your home and went to your aunt in Berlin. You wanted
to be part of the defense of the city. It was there you met with P.
(Ebert), a Nazi extremist. You weren’t very friendly, but you got close
as only comrade-in-arms can be. You were there until the end, until the
fall of the regime.

When the city was occupied, it became really horrible. There was
violence and chaos everywhere. You were taken in by a group of soldiers
once, and badly beaten, just for sports, before a French soldier rescued
you. Fortunately you were too young to be taken as a war prisoner, it
was just a bad case of bullying but it was still bad. And everyone knew
about soldiers stealing and pillaging and raping. The Russians were the
worst, the damn communists.

When the Berlin blocade started you were sent to live with another
relative in another city in West-Germany, for your safety. Life is
better now and more quiet, and you started to heal, but you have
difficulties remembering the hard times of the war. And there is
denazification and the discovery of the camps, too. You didn’t know,
most of the population couldn’t have known. You feel quite guilty about
it, but then, you have seen the violence of the Allied soldiers in
Berlin. Not one side of the war really feels better than the others
these days.

However, you’re determined to survive and make something of yourself. So
when the writing contest came in, you decided pretty quickly to
register, in the hope that it will be an opportunity for you to
undertake better studies and then have a better job. You’re even
considering leaving West Germany, trying to put the past behind you.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are strong-willed, energetic, and ambitious. In
spite of the hardship that you’ve had to endure, you can be a lot of fun
to hand around with. You like to crack jokes, and usually make friends
quite easily

**Dark Side:** you are really shocked and traumatized by your experience
of the war, but hide it under a cheerful and determined façade. However,
when alone, you suffer long bouts of depression and feel like nobody

### Description

You come from a family that was composed of early supporters of the Nazi
party. Your father had lost all of his brothers in the Great War, and
was very bitter over the defeat of Germany. He registered very early
with the Nazi party, and was determined to make Germany great again.
Your father rose in the ranks of the Party and even got an assignment in
Berlin.

Therefore you were drafted, with all your brothers and sisters, in the
ideology too. You were part of the Hitlerjugend and you loved it there.
You were also part of very extreme groups, which liked to chase
communists and Jews in the city to beat them up. The first time you had
to beat someone up and draw blood, you got a bit squeamish, but it soon
came to pass.

When the war started you were convinced that Germany would win the war,
that it would be revenge for the defeat in World War One, that Germany
deserved to rule the world. Then the situation became worse and worse,
and you realized that it was hard on your parents. Some of your siblings
died during the war. Your father looked more and more ill, but kept his
problems to himself, said that he couldn’t talk, his work was top
secret.

When Germany was invaded and Berlin besieged, you joined as a volunteer
to be part of the defense of the City. You wanted to be part of the
defense of the city. It was there you met with D. (Waechter). You
weren’t very friendly, but you got close as only comrade-in-arms can be.
You were there until the end, until the fall of the regime.

When the city was occupied, it became really horrible. There was
violence and chaos everywhere. And everyone knew about soldiers stealing
and pillaging and raping. You had to work to clear the rubble and the
dead bodies of people killed in the bombings. You know you were lucky
not to be assaulted by the occupying soldiers, that’s because you were
smart, you knew the routes to avoid the patrols.

You didn’t question your beliefs at all, in spite of the defeat of
Nazism. You’re still convinced you were right. But a couple of months
after the end of the war, just as the Nuremberg trials were beginning,
you entered the bathroom and found your father hanged to the ceiling. He
didn’t leave a suicide note. Just “I’m sorry”.

It was a shock for the rest of your family. Your mother drowned her
sorrow in alcohol, and now your last surviving older sister is taking
care of the both of you. Life is still hard and depressing. You suffered
food shortages, especially through the Berlin blockade.

When you heard about the writing contest, you applied because you
couldn’t put up with the gloomy atmosphere at home anymore. It was not
difficult to get your application through, you really are that good a
student. You want to be able to tell people the truth about what life
was really like in Germany. But what was it actually? You’re not quite
sure anymore

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are smart, energetic, a good student. You’ve always
be ambitious and always had good grades. You tend to work hard and
succeed in what you do. You are self-confident and usually have no
difficulty convincing people that you’re right

**Dark Side:** you haven’t given up the extremist ideas you grew up
with. You’re bitter and resentful over the defeat. The creation of the
European community feels absurd to you. You hide these ideas, but deep
down, you’re a very angry person. You feel like people are giving up too
easily, just like your father did.

### Questions

1. How do you feel about losing all of your brothers and sisters to the war, but one? Are you sad about it, or do you feel it was a legitimate sacrifice?
2. Germany has been military occupied and is now divided between West and East Germany. How do you feel about the situation? Do you still have friends or relatives in the East?
3. Were you really convinced by the Nazi ideology, or were you following it just to please your parents? Have your opinions changed since your father’s death?
4. Do you have any friends in the group? How do you feel about them?
5. Where do you see yourself in the future? Do you want to have a career? Do you want to have a family later, have children?

### What to do?

1. Try to minimize the violence of the Nazis, especially when compared to the violence of the communists
2. Tell about your accomplishments, good grades, success at school and otherwise. Show off a little
3. Find a friend to tell about your father’s death. Say if you feel more angry or sad over his disappearance
4. Find other people whose families supported the Nazi ideal, and interview them about their experience to get some material for your article
5. Decide if you want to start a neo-fascist group later, or if you’ll change your ideologies drastically

### Description

You come from a very traditionalist catholic Italian family. Some
ancestors on your mothers’ side of the family were actually aristocrats,
though the family has fallen on hard times ever since. Your father owned
a building company and was moderately successful in business. You were
the youngest of your siblings. You were the rebel of the family. You
didn’t want to study or make a proper marriage. You wanted to have it
your own way, become an artist and live free.

Unfortunately, these ideals of artistic accomplishment and liberty made
your parents very angry, and were forbidden under the strict fascist
rule. Your fathers’ company prospered under fascism, since he got a lot
of new contracts during the great works programs decided by the new
regime.

Your parents tried to force you to follow the fascist rule. Sometimes
you tried to pretend you agreed with them, other times you refused to
follow the orders, and got severe beatings for that.

You considered joining the antifascisti resistance, you even prepared a
bag in the hope of fleeing from home to live in the mountain, but you
were really too young and got scared on the way, fortunately you came
back before your absence was noticed. In the end you just had to put up
with your parents’ abuse day in and day out.

Your real act of rebellion came when you discovered a Jewish family in
hiding, the family Ferro. You lead them to a nearby barn to hide and
brought them food. It was a little act of resistance in the face of
fascism, and you regret there was nothing more you could have done.

When the Allied soldiers came, there were bombings and chaos everywhere.
Your father died in the fights, trying to defend the fascist regime. You
didn’t know what to feel about it. You should have been sad, but you
felt relieved. You haven’t discussed it with your mother. You are not
very proud that your father was fighting for the fascists. You’d rather
forget all about it.

During the occupation, American soldiers settled in your home, and you
got bullied for days on end before they finally left. Again, you wished
you could have fought them but chose to shut up like a coward.

You’re now fed up and you want to leave your family home to go study in
the big city, but your mother wouldn’t let you leave, not unless you
could take care of yourself. The writing contest therefore is a huge
opportunity for you: if you manage to publish an article, your mother
will be forced to take you seriously and let you leave.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side**: you’re a positive kind of person and always try to see
the good in others. You’re generally helpful and understanding. You
understand people’s flaws and try not to judge them for it. You also are
a good listener, people tend to like to confide in you. You’re also very
creative and always motivated by your work

**Dark Side**: you suffered a lot of violence in your life, from your
fathers and the foreign soldiers, which has left you very fragile and
vulnerable. You are therefore unwilling to take risks. You couldn’t pass
on the opportunity of the writing contest, but being so far from home
makes you very nervous

### Questions

1. How do you feel about your father’s death? Were you very sad, or were you glad to be rid of his abuse?
2. How do you feel about the European construction? Do you see it as a hope for Europe, or as a failed project no matter what?
3. Do you have any beliefs? Are you religious? Do you have a political affiliation?
4. Have you made any friends in the rest of the group? If so, who are you the closest with? If not, why is it so?
5. Are you really committed to being independent from your family and becoming a student, or are you actually afraid of having to take care of yourself on your own?

### What to do?

1. Find your favorite poem and read it to someone else in the group
2. Reconnect with G. (Ferro) and learn more about what they have become after escaping the fascist regime
3. Tell someone about your father dying during the war, and the sadness you felt upon first hearing it. Decide if you really felt sorry about it, and what your feelings are now.
4. Tell about how you regret you didn’t have the opportunity to actually fight the fascists
5. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article. Ask them about their experience of the war.

###Description

You come from a popular background, most of the men in your family were
peasants, then factory workers, and most women worked as servants or at
home. But they were generally good, hard-working people. It was not a
surprise, therefore, that they were all fervent socialists, and most of
them defended the Marxist ideal of the revolution.

When the fascists rose to power your family was of the resisting type.
They got into fights with the fascisti, even the women, and never gave
up. Your first memories as a kid were when you were standing guard to
watch out for the patrolmen when your parents were vandalizing the
fascists’ offices. It was fun back then, but now you realize that it put
you in a lot of danger, too young. It had left you with a reckless
character and a knack for provocation.

When your war a kid the civil war in Spain started and your father
decided to join the communist volunteers to supports the freedom
fighters against the dictatorship of Franco. He died there. Your family
was left heartbroken, and miserable. You fell on some very hard times,
sometimes you lacked food, and it became even worse after the war
started.

Your elder brother joined the Italian rebels, so there was only you and
your mother at home for a while. You wished you had been able to join
the fight, but you were too young to do so. And since you were the last
one home, your mother started being very over protective with you, it
was so annoying! Your brother came home a hero, and you feel like you
won’t get an opportunity to prove yourself. You are really tired of life
in the country

Finally you didn’t see much of the war, because your village was quite
isolated. With some other kids, you escaped the village to salute and
shout out after the American soldiers on the road, but that was about
it. After the war, relationships with your mother became more and more
tense. You joined the young communists and managed to leave last summer
to attend a communist meeting in Switzerland. Your mother was furious,
and locked you up even more. Now you’re threatening to immigrate to
America.

So when the writing contest came up, you immediately registered after
yet another fight with your mother. You’re sorry that things fell apart
like this. But if you get published, it is your ticket to a brilliant
career, you can’t miss on this opportunity.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side**: you are energetic and daring, you want to accomplish
things in life and take risks. You’re also confident enough to get other
people to follow your example by sheer force of persuasion. You always
want to show people how they can do best.

**Dark Side**: your taste for challenge can lead to take inconsiderate
risks and to be needlessly provocative in order to get a reaction or
emotional response from people. Therefore, you can be seen as quite
annoying.

### Questions

1. Were you sincere in joining the communists, or did you just want a pretext to escape from home?
2. Do you still feel inferior to your father and brother, who did some real fighting while you were stuck at home?
3. Do you really want to leave and go to America, or were you just trying to piss your mother off?
4. Have you made any friends within the group? Who do you feel the closer to?
5. What do you expect of the European construction? Do you sincerely belief it is a hope for peace in Europe?

### What to do?

1. Discuss communism with those who share the ideology and the kind of ideal society you would wish for
2. Challenge another student’s beliefs, even if you have to play the Devil’s advocate, just for the sake of argument
3. Tell a story about the arrival of the American troops, how impressive they were. Try to get people to share your enthusiasm for the “American Dream”
4. Interview other students to get ideas for your own articles. Be especially interested in people who have actually seen some fighting or bombings, to the point of being annoying.
5. Find another student who seems more reserved or isolated, and try to convince them to be more daring. It’s for their own good.

### Description

You had it rough and lost most of your family during the war. Sometimes
you wonder if you still have reasons to live.

Your mother was Italian but your father was French. You lived mostly in
Italy even though fascist made it difficult, although your family was
not very religious, you suffered from persecutions, even worse than the
communists. Your parents had a small grocery shop but started losing
clients because of fascist propaganda, and you fell on real hard times.
There were often food privations, and you grew up weaker than the other
kids, which was really frustrating.

You soon learnt that you had nothing to expect from life, that there was
no hoping in the future. Life under fascism was a series of endless
vexation, deprivation and suffering. You felt like you lived in a
prison. Your elder sister however was a rebellious spirit, she was soon
fed up with it all, and left to join the partisans, who fought against
fascism in the mountains. You learnt that she entered the battalion of a
guy named Forti, before getting no more news at all.

When your home area was invaded following the American landing in 1943,
you had to flee and hide. You were helped by the child of a neighboring
family, V. (Mozzato) who let you hide in the barn. Then you managed to
get to the border, but you crossed a fascist patrol and your mother was
shot. You managed to get at your aunt’s family, who was married to a
Frenchman, Mr Morin. You there met your cousin S. for the first time,
and you got along pretty quickly. But misfortunes kept happening in your
family. Your father and uncle were both arrested and deported, and were
never heard from again. So now all people remaining from your family are
you, your cousin and aunt. After the war you got a letter from your
sister, she was alive, but settled in Italy and wasn’t planning on
coming back anytime soon.

Life in liberated France was still very hard, you could get very little
food through food stamps, there were tensions and violence following the
liberation. You saw women being brutalized on the streets for
collaborating with the enemy, their hair shorn, in a rare display of
violence. All the while, high-ranking officials were protected and were
not prosecuted. It became clear to you that the persecuted people would
never get justice, in spite of the Nuremberg trials.

When you heard about the writing contest, you got interested. You
thought you could write about what it felt to be just shaken by the war,
having to live on the road and in poverty and fear of persecution. Your
cousin decided to register with you. You don’t believe that you have
much hope for a future, but you certainly have a story to tell.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** after travelling under duress and surviving hardship,
privation and loss, you have become a very resilient person. You don’t
usually get emotional, and not a lot of thing can unsettle you. This
strength of character can be very inspirational to others, when people
feel down-hearted you usually show them how a lot of people have had it
worse than themselves. It’s a pretty harsh way of doing things, but it’s
quite effective

**Dark Side:** you are bitter with life, still mourning your parents and
the childhood you never really had. You don’t really believe in better
prospects for a better future. To you, the war is the symbol of the
failure of humanity in general. To sum it up, you can be really
depressing when you get into your dark thoughts.

### Questions

1. Did you take the time to properly mourn your parents, or are you still in denial over the suffering their deaths caused you?
2. How do you feel about your cousin S.? Have you become really closed, or do you keep apart and prefer not to get too close?
3. Your parents were not very religious people, do you feel the same? Do you want to be religious? Would you rather invest in politics? Or do you prefer having no ideology at all?
4. What do you feel towards people who followed fascism? Do you hate them? Despise them? Do you think the Nuremberg trial were enough to give justice to the populations who suffered?
5. How do you imagine yourself in the future? Do you wish to have a career? A family?

### What to do?

1. Tell compelling and very dramatic stories about the way the fascist soldiers persecuted the population
2. Tell others in the group about the way V. helped you by hiding you and your family in the barn. Make sure to give it the credit it deserves.
3. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article. Focus on those who have suffered from the war
4. Feel sad about your parents and the many dead of the war and isolate yourself from the rest of the group for a while.
5. Say something hard to another participant about their own experience, especially if their family supported the fascists

### Description

You are the youngest of three siblings born to a wealthy aristocratic
family of Rome. Your parents were early supporters of Mussolini, when
the fascists started to get huge support from the conservative families
and the Roman Catholic Church. You therefore had a very comfortable
early childhood before Italy started losing the war. You saw very little
of it, really, unless the last two years of the war. Your father and two
brothers went to fight, you were too young so you had to stay with your
mother. When the American invaded you both left for the family estate in
the countryside, so you saw very little fighting and violence. You know
you’ve been fortunate that way, and often feel guilty that you were so
protected by your family when so many had to suffer and die.

It doesn’t mean that the aftermath of the fighting hasn’t been hard on
you. One of your brothers died. The other came back, but he has steadily
refused to talk about the war, and is drinking a lot to put up with the
pain. Your father was arrested and put on trial for war crimes. He was
condemned, among others things, for shooting another Italian that wanted
to entice rebellion amongst the troops, a corporal Mozzato. Now he’s
doing time in prison, which is really shameful and hard to admit.

After the war, the Republic was established. Your family has lost all of
its power and influence. You’ve caught up with your studies but you
really have no idea what you’re going to do with your life. You’ve never
had a lot of ambitions. You feel really useless, without any real
purpose in life.

Then you thought about the man your father had killed and wondered if
you could help his family. With the help of a family friend you were
able to track them down and meet them at church. He had a child about
your age. You managed to meet on the porch, and got friendly. They told
you about the writing contest, and that V. (Mozzato) wanted to enter.
You wouldn’t have thought about joining originally. After a while,
though, the idea took on. You still hadn’t found the strength to tell V.
about the truth about his father’s death. They should have learnt about
it from the trial, why haven’t they?

So you haven’t told anyone, and decided to join the contest too. Who
knows, maybe you’ll find a vocation or an idea about what to do with
your life. Your situation is really becoming critical and your family is
expecting you to make a career choice, the sooner the better.

### Light / Dark

**Light Side:** you are very understanding of other people’s flaws and
indecisions, since the mirror so many of your own. You are patient, a
good listener to other people’s problems. You are good at giving sound
advice, even if you never figured out anything for yourself.

**Dark Side:** you are really indecisive, because of how much you never
managed to figure out what to do with your life. You often hesitate,
always try to second-guess yourself. You really need a friend to help
you make the right decisions.

### Questions

1. What are you most ashamed of about your family? About yourself? Do you feel you can redeem yourself?
2. How do you feel about the European construction? Do you see it as a hope for the future of Europe, and Italy?
3. Do you have any beliefs? Are you religious? Do you have a political affiliation?
4. Have you made any friends in the rest of the group? If so, who are you the closest with? If not, why is it so?
5. What would you do in the future, if you could do anything you want? Do you want to stay with your family? Do you want to live on your own?

### What to do?

1. Interview other participants to find ideas for your article. Ask themparticularly about their plans for the future.
2. Confess about your father being in jail. Express the shame that you feel about your family.
3. Ask other participants for advice about what you should do in the future.
